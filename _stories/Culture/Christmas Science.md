<p>Chemistree, oh, chemistree… It’s the jolliest time of the year! Behind
the sparkle of holiday magic like tinsel, eggnog, and presents, though,
is a whole lot of science. Let’s unwrap the scientific elements of some
festive traditions.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>The Chemistry of Christmas Feasting</strong></h4>

<p>What makes a good holiday menu, gastronomically and chemically? Typical
Christmas foods like pudding and mince pie may not be so common in Singapore,
but <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/food/4-traditional-kristang-recipes-for-christmas" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Eurasian delicacies</a> like
devil curry are local twists on European favourites that commonly appear
on the Christmas dinner table. Singaporeans might also cook Western dishes
like turkey with <a href="https://www.visitsingapore.com/whats-happening/all-happenings/festivals/christmas/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Asian spices</a>,
such as ginger and chilli. But what makes certain ingredients taste so
good together?</p>
<p>One theory from chefs and food scientists is <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep00196" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">food pairing</a>, whereby
ingredients sharing flavour compounds (chemical profiles) are more likely
to pair well than ingredients with different flavour compounds. For example,
red wine and red meat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, another theory that has emerged is <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03330" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">food bridging</a>, where a third
ingredient <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03330" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">"smoothes contrast between ingredients"</a> that
have dissimilar flavour compounds. Researchers found that elements of these
principles appear across culinary traditions, albeit in interesting ways:
they concluded Southeast Asian food, for example, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03330" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">“avoids food-pairing and follows food-bridging.”&nbsp;</a>

<p>If you want to experiment with some novel new Christmas menus, try exploring
this <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-79422-8" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">flavour graph</a> to
look for ingredients that share chemical profiles, or a third ingredient
that could merge unusual flavours (watch this <em><a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg26034692-300-how-to-use-flavour-bridging-to-cook-a-bizarre-but-tasty-holiday-meal/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">New Scientist </a></em>

<h4><strong>The Physics of Christmas Tree Lights</strong></h4>

<p>Love strolling and admiring the Christmas light-up along Orchard Road?
If you’ve ever tried to decorate a Christmas tree with fairy lights, you
know that stringing up all those lights is a lot harder than it looks.</p>
<p>No, it’s not just your imagination – those Christmas tree lights really
are scientifically primed to get all tangled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several years ago, two physicists at the University of California, San
Diego conducted a study published in<em> <a href="https://pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.0611320104" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</a> </em>to
find out how easily knots form. The researchers shook strings of various
lengths in a mechanically-rotating box, as if tumbling<a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/521110/why-your-christmas-lights-always-get-tangled-according-science" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"> “socks in a dryer”</a>,
and measured how many knots appeared and how fast.&nbsp;</p>
<div class="iframe-wrapper">
<iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eRmfzNS9uyg?si=PXd6kE1xqELbVamt"></iframe>
</div>
<p>After repeating the experiment more than 3,400 times and crunching the
numbers, they concluded that the longer the string compared to its diameter,
and the more flexible the material, the more likely knots appeared.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given that for a 6-7 foot Christmas tree you may need anywhere between
<a href="https://www.idealhome.co.uk/all-rooms/all-rooms-decor/how-many-lights-do-i-need-for-my-christmas-tree" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">15-20 metres</a>of lights or more (which are designed to bend around the
tree branches), the length-to-diameter ratio and the flexibility of Christmas
lights make it more likely you’ll discover a tangled mess in your holiday
decorations storage box.</p>
<p>In addition, cords with intertwined metal wires like Christmas lights
tend to be shipped and packaged spooled, which introduces natural curvature
and make it even harder to straighten the cords (coincidentally, this is
why your wired earbuds become a tangled blob in your pocket). The light
bulbs don’t help either, since they become sticking points and introduce
friction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What’s the recommended way to get headache-free dazzling Christmas lights?
One suggestion is using <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/521110/why-your-christmas-lights-always-get-tangled-according-science" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">LED rope lights</a> instead
of fairy lights, since they are less flexible and yet still can wrap around
a tree.</p>
<p>If you still want the traditional look though, some <a href="https://www.livescience.com/why-do-christmas-lights-tangle" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">common hacks</a> are
to use twist ties to secure cord sections, or wrap the Christmas tree lights
tightly around cardboard sheets and tape down the edges. It’s knot you,
it’s physics!</p>
<h4><strong>The Mathematics of Christmas Carols</strong></h4>

<p>Mariah Carey’s time to shine is here. Besides infinitely repeating Christmas
carols in shopping malls, though, are there any interesting mathematical
patterns in holiday song lyrics?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s a puzzle for you: can you guess how many gifts the singer receives
in the <a href="https://genius.com/Christmas-songs-the-twelve-days-of-christmas-lyrics" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">"Twelve Days of Christmas"</a>?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lucky for you, mathematicians have broken down <a href="https://www.mathscareers.org.uk/the-maths-inside-the-twelve-days-of-christmas/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">the math</a> behind
the classic song’s running total of gifts like turtle doves, golden rings,
and a partridge in a petri–oops, pear tree!</p>

<p>If we write this mathematically, on day n, the singer receives 1+2+3+...+n
gifts from their true love, which is the <a href="https://www.cuemath.com/sum-of-natural-numbers-formula/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">sum of n natural numbers formula</a>.
The general formula can also be expressed as 1 + 2 + 3 + … + n = <a href="https://www.intmath.com/blog/mathematics/the-twelve-days-of-christmas-how-many-presents-1686" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">1/2n (n+1)</a>.
That’s a whopping 364 gifts over just 12 days – Santa’s sleigh must have
been busy!</p>
<p>There are some other cool patterns hidden in the lyrics, too. If you take
a closer look at the number of gifts received on each day (1 the first
day, 3 the second day, 6 the third day), they make up a set of numbers
known as <a href="https://www.seh.ox.ac.uk/blog/the-maths-of-the-12-days-of-christmas" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">triangular numbers</a>,
because they can be represented in dot form to make a triangle.</p>
