<p>Singapore's Peranakan tiles are well loved for their bold, eclectic designs.
With their aesthetics standing the test of time, you can find some of these
original ornamental tiles in <a href="https://jenniferlimart.com/blog/where-to-see-peranakan-tiles-in-singapore" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>shophouse facades along Katong, Joo Chiat, and Emerald Hill</u></a>.
Have you ever wondered about the elegant mathematical principles that create
these eye-catching mosaics?</p>
<p>First, some quick history. What we call "Peranakan tiles" are actually
<a href="https://noroadbarred.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/passage_mar-apr15.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u> tiles imported from European countries like England, Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands prior to World War I </u>
</a>to decorate the homes of the Chinese and <a href="https://www.nhb.gov.sg/peranakanmuseum/learn/about-the-peranakans" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Peranakan community</u></a> in
Southeast Asia. Art Nouveau and Art Deco majolica tiles (glazen earthenware)
were especially popular with their intricate floral and faunal motifs.</p>
<p><a href="https://noroadbarred.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/passage_mar-apr15.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Later in the 1920s, Japan started exporting majolica tiles</u></a> with
<a href="https://expatliving.sg/peranakan-tiles-in-singapore-story/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>designs rich in Chinese symbolism</u>
</a>, such as lotuses, peaches, plum blossoms, and dragons, to growing demand
in Singapore and across Malaya. These majolica tiles from different countries
eventually became so synonymous with local communities that they became
known in Southeast Asia as Peranakan tiles.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/uncovering-the-past-tile-by-tile" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>In a </u></a><em><a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/uncovering-the-past-tile-by-tile" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Straits Times </u></a></em>
<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/uncovering-the-past-tile-by-tile" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>feature published in 2019</u>
</a>, artist Jennifer Lim explained, “the tiles tell a story of Singapore's
complex cultural DNA and are a reminder of the nation's ability to absorb
and reinterpret outside trends and influences."&nbsp;</p>
<p>What about the science behind these mosaics of diverse cultures?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Creating durable ceramics involves <a href="https://exhibitions.bgc.bard.edu/majolicamania/making-majolica/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>chemistry, materials science, and technology</u></a>.
A clay mixture is carefully prepared and poured into a mould, dried, fired
in kilns, and then painstakingly glazed to achieve a shiny, glossy finish.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The intensely bright colours of original tiles came at a cost, though.
<a href="https://expatliving.sg/peranakan-tiles-in-singapore-story/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>In an interview with </u>
</a><em><a href="https://expatliving.sg/peranakan-tiles-in-singapore-story/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Expat Living</u></a></em>,
Victor Lim from the Peranakan Tile Gallery explains that "production of
these [original] tiles ended around 1935 and many of the materials used
in the process of creating and preserving the colour – like cobalt, copper
or manganese – were discontinued or are no longer in use due to their toxic
qualities."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides knowledge of minerals and materials, manufacturing of these tiles
involved designs with geometrical concepts.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://garlandmag.com/article/peranakan-tiles/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>In her story on Peranakan tiles in Malaysia</u></a>,
Ananya Mallick notes that "geometric motifs dominate many Peranakan tiles,
with recurring patterns of dovetailing shapes and symmetrical formations."
Mallick writes, "These motifs not only create a visually striking effect
but also symbolise balance and harmony—the foundational values in Peranakan
culture."</p>
<p>For example, Mallick states that "geometric lattice" designs are said
to protect households, while "basket weave" designs represent the unity
of the community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Individual Peranakan tiles feature qualities such as rotational symmetry
(when a pattern looks the same when rotated on its axis by a partial turn)
and reflection symmetry (when one half of the pattern is the mirror image
of the other half).&nbsp;</p>
<p>In certain tiles, you can even spot <a href="https://science.howstuffworks.com/math-concepts/fractals.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>fractals</u></a>.
Fractals are complex, never-ending patterns that, when zoomed in or out,
create a replica of the whole. For example, if you look at the branches
of a fern closely, the fern’s branches resemble the shape of the entire
frond. Since Peranakan tiles are inspired by nature, organic designs featuring
detailed plants or flowers may exhibit these principles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other Peranakan tile designs, such as the geometric lattice and basket
weave, show knot theory at work. In mathematics, <a href="https://quantamagazine.org/why-mathematicians-study-knots-20221031/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>knot theory</u></a> refers
to the study of mathematical knots. These knots are different from, for
example, tying shoelaces, in that their ends must be joined so they cannot
be undone. The interlacing circles and intricate lattices of some tiles,
perhaps inspired by Chinese knotting or the eternal knot, resemble some
mathematical knots.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the overall arrangement of Peranakan tiles on the floor,
wall, or bannister creates a form of tessellation. Tessellations or tilings
in mathematics are patterns of repeating shapes that fit perfectly on a
surface (typically a plane) with no overlaps or gaps.</p>
<p>While Peranakan tiles are decorative works that are not textbook examples
of these geometric concepts, these tiles can be a fun gateway to understanding
mathematics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beautiful patterns such as those featured in Peranakan tiles bridge art
and science. Beyond appreciating their aesthetics, studying these patterns
can have larger applications in other fields.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, fractal geometry helps us <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/news/top-5-applications-fractals" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>send images over the internet</u></a>.
Knot theory has been used by scientists to<a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/why-knots-matter-in-math-and-science-20220406/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u> unravel the structure of DNA</u></a>.
And in manufacturing, tessellations can help factories <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150529163032/http://www.withbotheyesopen.com/pdftransponder.php?c=13" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>create products from sheet metal with less waste</u></a>.&nbsp;</p>

you observe–they might just be a sign to understanding our wider world!</p>

can follow the YouTube tutorial to learn how to fold an origami hydrangea
flower that she used for the centre and corners of the Peranakan tile.
Origami, like mosaics, relies on a lot of geometry to create wonderful
art!</p>
