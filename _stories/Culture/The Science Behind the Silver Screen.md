<p><strong>Silver Screen: The Shiny Origins of Cinema</strong>
</p>
<p>You've probably heard the phrase "silver screen" associated with cinema.
Since the 1920s, the term has become <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/e/silver-screen-terms/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">synonymous with the entire film industry</a>.
While this catchy phrase may seem like just advertising hype, it actually
<a href="https://www.dictionary.com/e/silver-screen-terms/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">originates from early film projection technology</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the early 20th century, movie screens were typically basic white cloth
sheets. To enhance image clarity, film projectionists began experimenting
with coating the screen surfaces with silver, aluminium, or other metallic
paints. Silver’s superior reflective properties resulted in <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/posts/why-we-call-movies-the-silver-screen" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">sharper and brighter images.</a> Industry
innovators like <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/posts/why-we-call-movies-the-silver-screen" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Harry C. Williams</a> popularised
vinyl plastic silver screens (which were more durable than the cloth versions)
in the United States of America throughout the 1950s. Following the advent
of "talkies" (movies with synchronized sound), film projectionists further
improved silver screens. Screens were <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyAs5861m34" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">perforated with tiny holes</a> allowing
for clearer sound from speakers positioned behind the screen.</p>

</p>
<p>The association between silver and cinema also links back to the chemistry
of early filmstrips, which used "<a href="https://www.bfi.org.uk/features/all-about-nitrate-film" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">microscopic reactive silver salts</a>.”
Kodak's first commercially available photographic film roll in 1889 used
<a href="https://lightform.com/blog/the-history-of-projection-technology" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">cellulose nitrate</a>, a film stock that contained an emulsion composed
of silver halide compounds that reacted when exposed to light. Cellulose
nitrate was renown for its <a href="https://www.bfi.org.uk/features/all-about-nitrate-film" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">"luminosity and metallic lustre"</a> and
<a href="https://www.bfi.org.uk/features/all-about-nitrate-film" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">"jewel-like"</a>colours. However, it was also <a href="https://www.bfi.org.uk/features/all-about-nitrate-film" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">highly flammable</a>,
prompting manufacturers to pursue safer film bases after the 1950s.</p>

</p>
<p>Today, cellulose nitrate is classified as dangerous and carefully handled
by film archivists. Silver screens have replaced largely by <a href="https://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/movie-screen.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">matte white screens</a> offering
better viewing angles and colour accuracy, although their highly reflective
properties remain useful for 3D movies. Nevertheless, the phrase "silver
screen" endures, a linguistic artifact signalling cinema's technological
evolution.</p>
<p><strong>3D Movies: Tricking Your Brain</strong>
</p>
<p>How do 3D movies create eye-popping effects, transporting viewers right
into the scene? To understand how 3D movies work, we must first grasp stereoscopic
vision - our brain’s ability to <a href="https://www.visioncenter.org/conditions/stereoscopic-vision/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">"interpret visual information from both eyes to create a clear three-dimensional (3D) image.”</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try this one-minute experiment. Close your right eye and focus on a distant
object with your left eye. Then switch. Notice how the position of the
object appears to shift slightly depending on the eye? Our brains evolved
to process these slightly different 2D images into a single 3D image. The
optic nerve transmits both images to the brain's visual cortex, which
<a href="https://www.visioncenter.org/conditions/stereoscopic-vision" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">uses the differences to determine the object's distance</a>.</p>
<p>3D movies take advantage of stereoscopic vision by <a href="https://youtu.be/4JGmy_RUWYc" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">delivering a different image to each eye</a>.
Our brains fuse these two 2D images into a 3D spectacle, of say, Godzilla
stomping in the sea, with the ferocious waves appearing to splash mere
metres away from our seat.</p>
<p>While 3D movies may seem modern, the basic components of 3D film technology
dates back to the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/story/stereoscopy-the-birth-of-3d-technology-the-royal-society/pwWRTNS-hqDN5g?hl=en" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">1830s</a>.
The first commercially released 3D feature film <em><a href="https://www.acmi.net.au/stories-and-ideas/50s-third-dimension/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">The Power of Love</a></em> premiered
in 1922. 3D movies were shot with <a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/first-color-3-d-film-opens" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">two cameras or one twin-lensed camera</a> with
lenses spaced 6.3 centimetres apart, roughly the average distance between
a person's eyes. The two images from the camera were then projected simultaneously
onto the screen. To view early 3D films, audience wore white cardboard
red/blue or red/green glasses known as <a href="https://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/why-arent-3d-glasses-red-and-blue.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">anaglyph glasses</a>.
These 3D glasses used colour to <a href="https://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/why-arent-3d-glasses-red-and-blue.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">filter the image</a> for
each eye; for example, the red filter only let red light through, while
blue filter only let blue light through.</p>
<p>However, anaglyph glasses produced fuzzy images, and the colour of the
picture was always a bit off. In 1936, Edwin Land invented polarized lenses
that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/16/magazine/who-made-those-3-d-glasses.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">"worked with full colour.”</a> Cinemas
switched to <a href="https://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/why-arent-3d-glasses-red-and-blue.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">polarized 3D glasses</a> that
use light's direction, rather than colour, to filter images for each eye.
One image is polarized vertically, the other horizontally. Like anaglyph
glasses, the viewer's brain then did the magic of combining both images
into 3D.</p>

</p>
<p>While 3D movies are sometimes considered novelty gags, the 2000s saw another
3D renaissance with James Cameron’s <em>Avatar</em>. According to <em><a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/culture/movies/a5067/4339455/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Popular Mechanics</a></em>, <em>Avatar </em>pioneered
new technologies such as a 3D camera that presented an augmented-reality
view by "integrating the live actors into CG environments on the viewfinder.”
Today, even 2D movies can be converted to 3D using computer software.</p>
<p><strong>Dome Theatres: Immersion Maximised</strong>
</p>
<p>What's better than the big screen? An even bigger screen! Dome theatres
like IMAX's Omnimax theatres push the boundaries of immersion with giant,
curved screens that engulf the audience. Omnimax theatres feature steeply
inclined seats up to 30 degrees and use an ultra-wide lens (also known
as a fisheye lens) projection system in the middle of the seating area
to create a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Py4w7bF7Rw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">panoramic experience</a> for
the moviegoer.</p>
<p>Singapore's only immersive dome theatre, located at Science Centre Singapore,
boasts <a href="https://www.christiedigital.com/help-center/customer-stories/science-centre-singapore-omni-theatre-en/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Southeast Asia’s largest seamless dome screen</a> with
a diameter of <a href="https://www.science.edu.sg/visit-us/omni-theatre/about-omni-theatre" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">23 metres</a>.
Completed in 1987, the Omni-Theatre features “a massive hemispheric screen
tilted at a 30° angle to the horizon … covering 80% of the hemisphere”
according to <em><a href="https://doi.org/10.1142/9789813140905_0027" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">50 Years of Science in Singapore</a></em>.
For the average viewer, the screen fills <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Py4w7bF7Rw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">nearly their entire field of view</a>,
including peripheral vision where motion detection is particularly sensitive.
This creates an uncanny sense of really flying through space, trekking
through rainforests, or scaling mountains.</p>
<p>In 2015, the Omni-Theatre upgraded to an 8K digital planetarium projector
system featuring <a href="https://www.christiedigital.com/help-center/customer-stories/science-centre-singapore-omni-theatre-en/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">five Christie Mirage 304K projectors</a>.
This system includes a real-time science and astronomy database, allowing
educators to show stunning, ultra-high resolution&nbsp;visuals of the night
sky from any date at the click of a mouse. Want to see the awe-inspiring
Omni-Theatre dome screen yourself? Movie tickets are available <a href="https://www.gevme.com/scsonlinetickets" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
