<p>Ever wondered what happens behind the scenes at a science centre? Following
a hiatus due to COVID-19, Science Centre Singapore relaunched its volunteer
programme in January 2024 for individuals aged 14 and above to support
the Centre's initiatives. Today, the Science Centre has 165 regular volunteers,
with new faces joining every month.</p>
<p>In 2024, Science Centre Singapore volunteers contributed 3,202 hours sharing
the joy of science with the public. But their impact extends far beyond
numbers. In this feature, we spotlight the voices and stories of dedicated
volunteers who use their diverse talents to spark a positive science culture
in Singapore.</p>
<h4><strong>From Visitor to Volunteer</strong></h4>
<p>Many Singaporeans have fond memories of school excursions or family trips
to the Centre’s iconic exhibits, from the crackling lightning demonstrations
of the Tesla coil to the gravity-defying climbing Albert Einstein puppet.
For some wide-eyed young visitors, these outings have a lasting impact.</p>
<p>19-year-old Nayantara Liz Njondimackal, a biomedical engineering student
at the University of Sheffield, remembers marveling at a simple science
demonstration as a child: a Science Centre educator balancing a paper butterfly
to explain gravity. Little did she know this would be one of the events
setting her future career path in motion.</p>
<p>Several years later, Njondimackal had the opportunity to engage kids at
a balancing butterfly station for the It’s Physics Time event held from
31 August to 8 September 2024 in the Future Makers exhibition.</p>

</p>
<p>"I [went] to Science Centre a lot as a kid, so it's cool to be on the
other side, helping out with the activities that I used to participate
in," said Njondimackal.</p>
<p>Other visitors share a similar full-circle journey, going from childhood
fans to grown-up facilitators at the Science Centre. Their strong bond
with the Centre encouraged them to sign up as volunteers to inspire the
next generation to access their innate curiosity about science.</p>
<p>23-year-old Soh Yu Wei, a physics undergraduate at Imperial College London,
recalls one of his first experiences with Science Centre Singapore’s Observatory
when his parents brought him there during the 2012 transit of Venus.</p>
<p>"I was in primary school then. At that time I clearly grasped that it
was a rare event and was so excited to see the small dot on the sun. It
was just so mind boggling to me that I can witness the whole solar system
just by looking up at the sky," Soh shared.</p>
<p></p>

</p>
<p>As a volunteer at the Science Centre Observatory, Soh explains astronomy
concepts and helps operate telescopes during stargazing sessions for the
public. He is motivated by his formative experiences at the observatory
to conduct night-sky tours to “give back to the younger generation.”</p>
<p>And it's not just the kids who get starry-eyed: adults can be astonished
by science, too. To Soh, "everyone has this innate wonder of the universe
in them.” Most of the visitors he interacts with at the Observatory are
parents with their children. Although parents may just "peek at the telescope"
at first, Soh shares, "when I explain how far in the past they are viewing,
they are always surprised, and I can see them begin to appreciate what
they’re looking at."</p>
<p>"They display this childlike sense of wonder when observing the object.
It is so rewarding to see them enjoy the beauty of the cosmos," Soh said.</p>
<h4><strong>Beyond the Lab</strong></h4>
<p>While no prior science background is required to volunteer at Science
Centre, many of the Centre’s volunteers who are STEM professionals find
the volunteer experience deeply enriching as it helps bridge the gap between
scientific research and the general public.</p>
<p>During the monthly Discovering DNA workshops in 2024, 29-year-old Suresh
Pillai S/O Balasubramaniam Pillai, a Master’s student in chemistry at Nanyang
Technology University, assisted participants with activities like extracting
strawberry protein.</p>
<p>Pillai, who also interns at the Proteins4Singapore department of multidisciplinary
research platform TUMCREATE, explained that the fundamental science behind
these fun experiments could be extrapolated to more advanced applications
such as current food chemistry research on alternative non-animal proteins.</p>

</p>
<p>The graduate student further shared how a perfume activity from the Sci-sational
Christmas event held from 14-25 December 2024 reminded him of food technologists
who are recreating the scents of roasted chicken and other smells.</p>
<p>"It’s nice to see something you learn in secondary school - something
very small - now [expanded] in food science… being translated from school
to industry," Pillai said.</p>
<p>These hands-on science activities in informal learning spaces like Science
Centre can capture the public’s imagination and make the latest STEM innovations
more tangible.</p>
<p>37-year-old research chemist Zhang Xing, who has been volunteering at
Science Centre for one year, explained his motivation over email to “help
to increase the public's interest in the sciences (and more importantly
the scientific way of thinking).”</p>
<p>At events like the public moon-gazing facilitated by Science Centre Observatory
at Singapore Chinese Cultural Centre's Mid-Autumn Festival from 6-8 September
2024, Zhang explains he "had to stretch both my astronomy knowledge and
people-engagement skills" for his station, modeling the moon phases using
Lego bricks.</p>
<p>He was challenged to interweave "the traditional lores and the scientific
explanations" to makethe celestial objects more relatable, a task that
was "very taxing but extremely rewarding."</p>
<p>By communicating science to the public, Zhang “see[s] volunteering as
a way to remind myself of my original passion when I chose to pursue a
career in scientific research.”</p>

<h4><strong>Positive Science Community</strong></h4>
<p>Whether they're students, working professionals, or science enthusiasts,
these volunteers share a common goal: making science exciting for all.
Through these interactions, volunteers from all backgrounds find themselves
part of a diverse and vibrant science community.</p>
<p>14-year-old triple science student B. K. Sreeya, a science aficionado
who also participates in her school’s science and environmental club, decided
to volunteer as “Science Centre provided an opportunity to interact with
people from different age groups,” from toddlers to senior citizens.</p>
<p>“Most might think STEM is something that they cannot relate to because
they usually think of deep research projects or advanced clinical trials…it
can be quite ‘chim’ or ‘atas’,” Sreeya noted over email. However, her experience
facilitating science activities with young children at the KidsSTOP™ Mess-ive
Science Party proved to her that science can be made "relatable to everyone."</p>

</p>
<p>A 32-year-old volunteer who preferred to remain anonymous further emphasised
the importance of making science accessible and engaging.</p>
<p>“Science can also be fun... it can be catered to a young age and also
be playful,” he said, reflecting on activities like the bubble-making station
at KidsSTOP™ Mess-ive Science Party from 31 May-9 June 2024, where kids
experimented with bubbles as tall as themselves.</p>
<p>His other volunteer experiences, such as teaching visitors how to use
assistive technologies like a braille typewriter at Science Centre’s World
Autism Day event from 28-31 March 2024, helped support a holistic and inclusive
science community.</p>

</p>
<p>Volunteering at the Centre has provided volunteers with a platform to
meet other like-minded science geeks and foster a positive science culture
in Singapore.</p>
<p>"Volunteering at Science Centre has made me more confident to present
and talk to people I have not met before, and also make new friends along
the way," Sreeya said.</p>
