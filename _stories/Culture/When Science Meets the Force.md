<p>From massive sea bugs to groundbreaking artificial skin, Star Wars has
left its mark on science. Earlier this year, when an ASEAN team of researchers
including Prof. Peter Ng from the Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum
discovered a new giant isopod species in the South China Sea, its helmet-like
head earned it the name <em><a href="https://lkcnhm.nus.edu.sg/meet-darth-vader-a-collaborative-discovery-across-borders/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Bathynomus vaderi</a></em> after
Darth Vader, arguably cinema's most iconic villain.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.livescience.com/animals/crustaceans/new-supergiant-darth-vader-sea-bug-discovered-in-south-china-sea-and-its-absolutely-massive" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">"supergiant Darth Vader sea bug"</a> is
one of the most recent scientific discoveries referencing the beloved space
opera series. Other examples of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_organisms_named_after_the_Star_Wars_series" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">growing list of species</a> connecting
pop culture with scientific research include <em><a href="https://doi.org/10.4289/0013-8797-111.1.166" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Wockia chewbacca</a></em> moth
(a fuzzy Mexican moth named after Chewbacca) and the elegant <em><a href="https://begonia.wiki/index.php/Begonia_amidalae" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Begonia amidalae</a></em> (a
speckled begonia in Borneo named after Queen Padmé Amidala). But the science
fiction franchise's influence extends far beyond scientific names.</p>
<p>In laboratories in Singapore and beyond, childhood dreams of Star Wars
technology are becoming reality. In 2020, Singaporean technologist Benjamin
C. K. Tee, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2018/03/21/health/benjamin-tee-tomorrows-hero/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">inspired by Luke Skywalker's sophisticated bionic hand</a>,
developed an <a href="https://nus.edu.sg/alumnet/thealumnus/issue-126/perspectives/frontiers/searching-for-a-new-sensation" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">electronic skin that recreates the sense of touch</a>.
Like many scientists committed to pushing the final frontier, the Associate
Professor’s team at NUS Department of Materials Science and Engineering
works to transform what was once science fiction into tangible innovation.</p>
<p>While Star Wars may seem more fantasy than hardcore science fiction, its
fusion of mythological storytelling and futuristic technology has spurred
real-world scientific advancement—from <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-have-created-star-wars-style-holograms-in-the-lab" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">holograms</a> to
<a href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/nvidia-google-and-disneys-ai-powered-star-wars-robot-is-absolutely-the-droid-ive-been-looking-for" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">artificial intelligence</a>. At Science Centre Singapore, the interplay
between science fiction and science fact creates powerful opportunities
for STEM learning.</p>
<h4><strong>A Force for Science Education</strong></h4>
<p>Star Wars’s impact on public engagement with science in Singapore began
with the release of the first Star Wars film here in 1978. A year later,
Science Centre Singapore organised <a href="https://biblioasia.nlb.gov.sg/vol-13/issue-2/jul-sep-2017/sci-fi-in-singapore/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">a science fiction short story writing competition</a> to
encourage science fiction as a gateway to science. The Centre later hosted
The Art of Star Wars exhibition from November 2005 to April 2006, setting
the stage for future science fiction initiatives.</p>
<p>In 2024, Science Centre Singapore held the inaugural Sci-Fi Fiesta from
1-5 May. The Centre also hosted Star Wars Day celebrations in collaboration
with local fan group #MayThe4thSG during the 4-5 May weekend. At Sci-Fi
Fiesta stations, visitors built space vehicles, played with light reflection
to create invisibility shields, and examined alien-looking organisms under
microscopes.</p>

</p>
<p>At booths manned by Star Wars fan groups, visitors built their very own
lightsabers using household materials, joined bounty hunts looking for
droids, and exercised their artistic skills in toy photography workshops.</p>

</p>
<p>At Science Centre Singapore, Star Wars serves as more than entertainment—it's
a powerful force for public engagement with science. When organising Sci-Fi
Fiesta and the Star Wars Day weekend, James Emmann Lim, a Master Science
Educator at the Centre, harnessed the franchise's appeal to make technical
concepts accessible.</p>
<p>"Science fiction is a draw for discussions and scientific discovery,"
James explains. He mentions how famous science communicators like <a href="https://screenrant.com/neil-degrasse-tyson-star-wars-scientific-accuracy/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Neil deGrasse Tyson</a> have
used Star Wars to unpack scientific principles from hypothetical interstellar
travel to the reality of sound in space.</p>
<p>While the films take creative liberties—like the <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/news/knowledgecentre/science/maths-statistics/starwarsasteroid" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">unrealistically dense asteroid belts</a> the
Millennium Falcon manoeuvres , or the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-24518305" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">improbably loud pew-pew blaster gun noises</a>—these
scenes spark valuable conversations about the real-world physics of space.</p>
<p>James gives the example of the Kaminoan clone army in Star Wars as fiction
that can get audiences curious to find out more about genetic engineering,
cloning, and biotechnology.</p>
<p>Sharp-eyed visitors might notice Star Wars-related references around the
Centre, from a Darth Vader figurine in Edison Lab, the Centre’s multimedia
classroom, to familiar Star Wars tunes sung by the Tesla coil during the
<a href="https://www.science.edu.sg/whats-on/shows-demonstrations/energy-titans-show" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Energy Titans Show</a>. These 'easter eggs' serve as fun ways to get people
excited about STEM.</p>
<h4><strong>Thank the Maker</strong></h4>
<p>Step into the Gallery Experience office at Science Centre Singapore and
you’ll immediately notice two desks displaying an impressive shrine of
Star Wars collectibles. James, together with Alfred Lim, another Master
Science Educator at the Centre, are widely known amongst staff as diehard
Star Wars fans. The duo have even dressed up as a Scout Trooper and Chewbacca
for staff Dinner and Dance events.</p>
<p>Standing at 183 cm—the exact height of clone troopers—James found his
niche in the local Star Wars fan community building screen-accurate costumes
from scratch. &nbsp;Building the props "was the hook for me, being an engineer
[since] I like to tinker," James said.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>

</p>
<p>As a former industrial engineer, James&nbsp;was excited to apply his manufacturing
knowledge to Star Wars fandom. "All the things [of propmaking] were familiar,
like my armour or vacuum foam ... how to deal with fillers, Bondo material,
how to glue, how to snap things, paint, cut… these are all engineering
things," James observes.</p>

</p>
<p>He even moulds or machines intricate little bits called "greeblies" or
"greebles" to make props look more utilitarian and complex, like real armour
straight out of science-fiction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>James and Alfred are both members of the 501st Legion Singapore Garrison,
part of a worldwide Star Wars costuming organisation recognized as Lucasfilm's
preferred Imperial stormtrooper costuming organisation. Outside work, they
regularly participate in charity events, using their passion for Star Wars
for community service.</p>
<p>"It's a win-win... I get to do what I love [and] help charity donations,"
James said.</p>
<p>Even beyond the Centre, James shares his engineering expertise with novice
Star Wars costume makers, creating a community of learners passionate about
making stuff from science fiction come to life.</p>
<p>Those familiar with Star Wars lore will remember that the protagonists
are often makers, such as Anakin Skywalker assembling and programming C-3PO.
The franchise is full of inspiration for budding engineers.</p>
<h4><strong>Training the Next Generation</strong></h4>
<p>On a broader level, the master-apprentice relationship central to Star
Wars resonates with James’s teaching approach. As a Master Science Educator,
James trains junior staff in visitor engagement and science communication.</p>
<p>In Star Wars, “there's always a master and apprentice," he reflects. "It’s
up to you to discover what the master has discovered, and maybe even surpass
the master."</p>
<p>To James, from an educator’s perspective, the Star Wars series stresses
the importance of seeing learning as an ongoing journey and passing down
knowledge to the younger generation.</p>
<p>He points out that "the sci-fi a few years ago, maybe fifty years ago,
sixty years ago, is already reality."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Star Trek, our phones, the Internet, AI, robotics, all of these were
science fiction ... now they're all reality and part of everyday life."
James sees the genre as a thought-provoking and imaginative way to get
the public to dream and "push scientific achievement."&nbsp;</p>
