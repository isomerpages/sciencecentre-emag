<p>Have you ever watched a science fiction film and immediately pointed out
the scientific discrepancies or was impressed by its scientific accuracy?
How much science is in science fiction?</p>
<p>On 30<sup>th</sup> May 2025 from 6.30PM to 8.30PM, participants gathered
at The BookBar with a rocket scientist, and a science poet to explore how
intertwined the sciences are (or can be) with film and literary art forms.</p>
<p>Simon Gwozdz, CEO and founder of space company Equatorial Space, originating
in Singapore, shed light on how rockets are built, what is required for
them to take flight, and gave an introductory lesson on space matters –
enough to highlight how films can sometimes misrepresent the science. One
example being the perception of distance in space versus its actual distance.</p>

<p>Participants were then introduced to local ‘science poet’ Cheyenne Alexandria
Phillips who showed a sample of poetry form influenced by science – the
nucleus poem. Where each line’s number of syllables are determined by a
chosen atom’s number of electrons.</p>
<p>Later, abstracts from science journals were handed out for a black-out
poetry activity. For black-out poetry, poets would have to cancel out words
(blacken out with a marker), leaving their own selected remaining words
to form a poem.</p>
<p>Here is a sample!</p>

<p>Fun fact: speakers, Simon and Cheyenne, and along with café host Meng,
were all university mates in the same student hall!</p>
