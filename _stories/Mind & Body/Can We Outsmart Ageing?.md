<p></p>
<p>Singapore stands at a demographic crossroads. According to previous projections,
this year, more than 21% of our population will be 65 and above, officially
making us a <a href="https://www.agewellsg.gov.sg/about/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">"super-aged"</a> society—a
milestone that brings both challenges and opportunities for how we think
about growing older.</p>
<p>As Singaporeans invest in fitness gear and set New Year health resolutions,
a deeper question emerges: how can we age well, and what if the very nature
of ageing isn't what we think it is?&nbsp;</p>
<p>To explore the science of ageing, the <em>Void Deck</em> team spoke with
Dr. Peter Fedichev, a theoretical physicist turned biotechnology entrepreneur
who brings an unusual perspective to ageing research.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As co-founder and CEO of Gero, a Singapore-based longevity startup, Dr.
Fedichev uses artificial intelligence and real-world data to develop therapeutics
that could one day combat the ageing process itself. With over 20 years
of experience spanning academic research and biotechnology, Dr. Fedichev
is a pioneer in a new field called gerophysics that applies physics principles
to the study of ageing.</p>
<p>Read on to discover Dr. Fedichev’s insights on why bats offer eye-opening
lessons on ageing, how entropy drives cellular damage, and the opportunities
for longevity research in Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The following interview was held in July 2025. It has been shortened and edited for clarity.</em>
</p>
<p><strong>VD: How would you explain what ageing actually is? Is it just about getting older, or is there more to it?&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>DR. FEDICHEV: </strong>People are saying that we are getting wiser
as we age. The truth is that our cognitive abilities decline after about
the age of thirty. Almost any thirty-years-old chess player can defeat
a six-years-old chess player, but there are no sixty-five-plus-years-old
masters of chess, so no amount of wisdom can compensate for the decline
in function.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For many people, ageing is a body shape variation. That's what people
are concerned with a lot. But on top of that is loss of function–cognitive
function. In sport medicine, there is another indicator, <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/vo2-max-what-is-it-and-how-can-you-improve-it" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">VO2 max</a>,
which can be measured by many even hand-held devices these days. This is
essentially your ability to consume oxygen. This is like your power output.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Believe me, I mean, the data shows that—and you can also see it with your
parents, grandparents, and everybody else—that it's hard to climb to the
fifth floor if you're old. The ability to produce energy also declines
more or less linearly with age. At some point, at about [a] hundred years
old, this declines to a point that it's even hard to breathe, right.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So ageing is a loss of function, and that loss of function also implies
that your body cannot protect you from diseases. People of advanced age
suffer from infections which don't kill younger people—and COVID-19 was
the [strongest] example—and people of age suffer from diseases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So loss of function, which is ageing, leads to decline everywhere, age-related
diseases, and sudden death from things that cannot kill a young man.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>VD: So essentially you're saying that ageing is related to the resilience of one's body?&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>DR. FEDICHEV:</strong> Yeah, overall, I mean, there are many aspects
to that, but it's really functional decline.</p>
<p>Look at people who are very old, ninety-years-old or hundred-years-old,
surprisingly, these people are almost free of diseases. All their friends
who had diseases are dead by that age. They are free from diseases, so
technically they should be happy, but functionally they are ruined. I mean,
if you look at anyone who is [a] hundred years old, these people functionally
are in a terrible state, so this is ageing, unrelated to diseases, right,
so there are like two components to that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can try to catch up with diseases as much as you want, and that's
what the standard medicine is doing right away, right, if you have a diagnosis,
they give you a pill or they give you a surgery, right, so that's how to
keep people disease-free.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in this way you don't intercept ageing, which is functional
decline, so that's why I think it's very important to understand that ageing
is not about diseases. Although, yes, lots of diseases come with ageing.
If you focus too much on diseases, you'll end up in a situation where you
don't have diseases, but you are a totally destroyed version of yourself.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>VD: Speaking about ageing, nature seems to have some fascinating exceptions to ageing. We have the <a href="https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/immortal-jellyfish-secret-to-cheating-death.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">immortal jellyfish</a>, <em>Turritopsis dohrnii</em>. We have the <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/naked-mole-rats-defy-biological-law-aging" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">naked mole-rat</a>. So could you tell us a bit more about animals that either age very slowly or don't seem to age at all?&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>DR. FEDICHEV: </strong>I think it's a very remarkable story because
people knew that there are certain primitive creatures that do not age
or can regress.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>VD: Yeah, like the immortal jellyfish.&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>DR. FEDICHEV:</strong> Exactly, or there are these <a href="https://scitechdaily.com/this-bizarre-immortal-creature-could-hold-the-secret-to-reversing-aging/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">planarians</a>.
There are these worms that you can cut in many, many pieces, and each of
them regenerates into a full worm. So basically, if these guys are bored
and cannot find a mating partner, they simply attach themselves to a tree
and cut themselves into pieces and they can still reproduce. Right, so
if you are alone in the universe, this is not the end of the story. So
these guys are technically immortal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And by the way, I knew about that when I was a schoolboy. I was very interested
in biology. I was interested in science overall, and I knew about those
examples. But who are they and who am I, right? I am an apex of creation.
I am, you know, the most advanced animal on Earth <em>[laughs wryly]</em>—I
mean, that's at least my feeling was.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I think this is an example of negligence, criminal negligence in science,
because it turns out that there are mammals that age very slowly or presumably
do not age.&nbsp;</p>
<p>People started suspecting about it in [the] late twentieth century, but
I mean that's still very close. And then in 2006 there was a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1474-9726.2006.00237.x" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">publication</a> by
Professor Buffenstein that those naked mole-rats, which are mammals, do
not show signs of ageing. They don't show signs of functional decline.
And of course, as always in science, they tell, maybe they show [signs
of ageing], maybe in a long time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the issue is that in biology there is a very strong correlation. If
you are small, you die quickly. If you are a fly or if you are a mouse,
mice live like two years or something. And then if you are a whale, you'll
live hundreds of years, right? So if you have a creature the size of a
mouse and lives forty years, then I want to have this ability.</p>
<p><strong>VD: Is there a specific animal that really piques your interest? Do you have one?&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>DR. FEDICHEV: </strong>I started with naked mole-rat, obviously,
because that was proven. It's important in science to have proven examples,
right, [because] we can speculate whatever. Also, think about this–assume
that today you decided that yes, there are mammals that do not age.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Obviously, when people who were doing biology of ageing for the last 10,000
years, when they faced this presumably non-ageing animal, there was denial,
like, "it ages, but very slow", "look, these guys don't control body temperature,
they are probably almost hibernated, that's why they live longer."&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then, since you're asking me, what is the example which kind of negates
all these arguments? These are <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11580778/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">bats</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So bats, one third of them [do] not age or age very slowly. So not most
of them, but lots of them do not age slowly. And think about it. Most of
the time people say that you don't age if you have low metabolism. But
believe me, if you want to fly and be a mammal, you cannot have low metabolism.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So to me, this is an indication that longevity is not a compromise, because
many people [are] afraid that, you know, you have to do [a] healthy lifestyle,
boring life, preserve yourself at all times, sleep the whole day, wear
[a] protective suit or something like that, and maybe you will live another
ten years longer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's not the case in nature. You can be as metabolically active as a
flying mammal and still not age. And to me, that tells you that there is
a very good story there.&nbsp;</p>

</div>
<p></p>
<p><strong>VD: You are a leader in a new field called gerophysics. But what exactly is gerophysics, and how does physics help us understand the biology of ageing?&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>DR. FEDICHEV:</strong> There was a gentleman in Great Britain in
the early twentieth century who discovered the structure of atom, <a href="https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/ahf/profile/ernest-rutherford/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Professor Rutherford</a>,
who was the Nobel Prize winner. He said once that there are only two kinds
of sciences, “<a href="https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/acref/9780191826719.001.0001/q-oro-ed4-00009051" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">there is physics and there is stamp collection</a>.”
So, anecdotally, he won his <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/1908/rutherford/facts/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Nobel Prize in chemistry</a>  <em>[laughs]</em>,
but nevertheless, I think physics is at the forefront of science in many
ways.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Physics uses lots of mathematics, lots of modelling, lots of computation.
So historically physics was maybe the main science everywhere that was
advancing our understanding of the universe. Physics has a culture of dealing
with complex systems, and to nobody’s surprise, human bodies are sufficiently
complex.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think modern biology now has lots of tools to understand what happens
on a molecular level in almost every cell. But that's precisely the situation
where people stop seeing the forest behind the trees. So physics has a
culture of generalising, of finding features that are a lot more important
than others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because look, we have different races, we have different lifestyles, and
still we live more or less the same lives. People in ancient Rome or Greece,
if they survived till forty, they could well live up to eighty. You can
live here. You can live in ancient Rome. You can have different diets and
still, the life expectancy doesn't change five times. So that tells you
that ageing is something about very universal features of biological systems.
That's precisely what physics is studying. Physics is studying universal
features of complex systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>VD: So to sum it all up, gerophysics is really using physics, the concepts of physics to study ageing.</strong>
</p>
<p>DR. FEDICHEV: Exactly. [Gerophysics aims] to study ageing across different
animals, to study the most universal manifestations of ageing, because
those things that are universal are more likely to be controlled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[If] you want to develop drugs that work in mice [and] in humans, right,
for trials, you want to end up with drugs that work in all humans. And
for that you have to find mechanisms that are the most universal, and that's
precisely what physics is doing.</p>
<p><strong>VD: <a href="https://agingcelljournal.org/Archive/Volume2/20240031/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Your research</a> shows that entropy may play a key role in ageing. Could you explain what entropy is and how does it affect our cells? Maybe using an everyday example?&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>DR. FEDICHEV:</strong> Yeah, well, first of all, it's very unfortunate
that entropy drives ageing in humans. As we all know, if you have a kid’s
room, or if you have your computer, in principle you can keep all your
things in order. That's what people in hospitals are trying to do. But
then, once in a while, a certain piece of a Lego set will disappear. No
matter what. And then the whole piece, the whole set cannot be assembled
anymore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a very small thing, nothing life threatening. But then one of
the systems, this Lego set cannot be assembled anymore. So we're built
of, nobody even knows, how many molecules that work in a precise concert
with each other to keep our body shape, for example. And of course, sometimes
this complicated machinery just makes a very rare error.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of the time, this error can be fixed. But you know, we have too many
things to do. Our bodies, evolutionarily, are trained to respond to stresses,
to pathogens. So your body decides whether to fix that little thing, or
maybe do an important thing. Maybe you're under attack. Maybe you are under
attack by bacteria right now. So maybe that little piece doesn't matter
so much compared to the immediate stress that you are getting. So as you
are getting older, more and more, those little things are not fixed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the problem is that they are so much under the hood of your machinery
that you have to stop the whole machine actually to find out which of them
are broken. So essentially you have no time, no focus to fix them. And
all those non-fixed things, they just build up, build up, and build up.
The problem is where the entropy comes in, because entropy is disorder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the disorder here is that you have cell A and cell B. Each of them
work the whole life, like two neural cells that work the whole life. And
then cell A acquired this pattern of those small little things broken,
and cell B acquired another bunch of little things broken. And these sets
of broken things are not even the same. There are no two cells that have
the same pattern of broken things, which means that you cannot come with
a single intervention that will fix all the problems, because they're all
different.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the entropy here is this very complex pattern of failures. Each of
them is benign, but together they build up in such a quantity that they
produce stress, and that stress changes our body shape, destroys function.
So we are just, you know, just leaning towards [the] earth under the pressure
of those.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's essentially damage. The damage that is so different in so many different
cells that it's totally incomprehensible, and that's why it's very hard
to control, and that's why it's very hard to revert.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>VD: So speaking about ageing potentially being reversible–in your opinion, is biological ageing inevitable?&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>DR. FEDICHEV:</strong> That's a very good question, because I could
tell you whatever I wanted, but since we have animals where the rate of
ageing is either zero or very small, it's up to you to decide, right, from
the limited evidence that we have. At least we have mammals that where
ageing is very slow. To me, that tells you that it's not inevitable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what this physics is telling you is that ageing is very hard to revert.
That's true, but you can still stop it.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>VD:</strong> It’s not impossible.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>DR. FEDICHEV:</strong> It’s not impossible to stop, right. In complex
animals, the level of control that is required to reverse ageing is so
large that you don't expect medical technologies within, let's say, next
ten years to show up and actually being able to do that. In science and
in technology, you never say never, right. I mean, "never" means "hard."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think the practical conversation here is that because society is ageing
so quickly we don't have lots of time to actually deal with that.</p>
<p>On a personal level, if I tell you that there would be a technology in
fifty years that would solve the problem, it doesn't look very encouraging.
So I think that--and this is our prediction, by the way--we believe that
in ten years it's super realistic to build technologies that slow down
ageing, if not completely, but like 10x, rather than demonstrate the technology
that provides a meaningful age reversal, so no reversal theorem for ageing
in ten years.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>[The scientific debate on whether halting ageing or human rejuvenation is a better approach to healthy longevity is hotly contested. To explore the arguments from both sides, check out the 2024 livestreamed debate <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1047456" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">“How to Defeat Ageing”</a> organised by Open Longevity, where Dr. Fedichev presents his perspective in more detail.]</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>VD: With Singapore being one of the fastest ageing nations in the world, how might understanding the science of ageing help us to prepare for this demographic shift? And what opportunities do you see for young Singaporeans who are interested in this field?&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>DR. FEDICHEV: </strong>Well, first of all, this is not only a
problem of Singapore, but a problem of many other Asian countries, especially
look at Japan right now. And since this is a global trend, it means that
people who would be working on technologies to first stop, and then hopefully
even revert ageing in the future, will be on the forefront of technological
development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the National University of Singapore there is a <a href="https://coe.nuhs.edu.sg/Centre-for-Healthy-Longevity" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">world-class longevity centre</a> led
by world-famous scientists. I think for people who want to solve, really,
a big practical problem, get famous, earn a lot, Singapore offers a possibility
to train with the best people in the field with the support of the government
understanding the issue. I think this is a very unique situation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So for those who are interested in AI, biology, maybe physics and longevity
and entrepreneurship around therapeutics against ageing, I think Singapore
is probably [the] one singular interesting place in the world right now.&nbsp;</p>
