<p>If your New Year's resolution is to get fit in 2025, you might want to
consider this workout hack that can accommodate any schedule.</p>
<p>The latest trend in the fitness world is (drum roll, please)... exercise
snacks. No, not granola bars or protein shakes, but bite-sized high-intensity
movements that you can easily treat yourself to throughout your day.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/exercise-snacks" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Cleveland Clinic</u></a> defines
exercise snacks as "high-intensity movement or exercise that typically
lasts for no more than two minutes." Think stair climbing, jumping jacks,
chair squats, pushups—movements that would make it difficult to continue
talking while performing the exercise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While conventional wisdom might suggest that pumping it in the gym for
an hour-long workout might make you "harder, better, faster, stronger"
(Daft Punk, anyone?), recent research suggests that we don't necessarily
need a grueling sweat session to start to reap the benefits of exercise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/15598276241253160" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>summary of the current literature</u></a> around
exercise snacks published in the <em>American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine </em>showed
that "exercise snacks showed significant benefits on cardiorespiratory
fitness, including decreased total cholesterol, increased oxygen consumption,
and overall cardiovascular function." Exercise snacks can also help us
live longer and well. A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-02100-x" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>2022 study</u></a> done
in the UK concluded that "small amounts of vigorous nonexercise physical
activity are associated with substantially lower mortality."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Just how little exercise does it take to see a difference?&nbsp; This
<a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/early/2024/12/28/bjsports-2024-108484" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>UK study published in October 2024 </u>
</a>showed that among non-exercising women, even just 3.4 minutes of vigorous
activity a day were associated with substantially lower risk of all major
cardiac events, including heart failure and stroke.</p>
<p>Exercise snacks are great for starting a new habit or adding to your existing
fitness routine as they can be peppered in throughout the day. You can
jog up the stairs instead of taking the elevator at your workplace, for
example, or do some squats after a Zoom meeting to get you out of your
chair and back on your feet.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hpb.gov.sg/newsroom/article/singapore-s-physical-activity-guidelines-revised-to-tackle-sedentarism-and-promote-variation-in-physical-activity" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Singapore's Physical Activity Guidelines</u></a> set
by Sport Singapore and the Health Promotion Board recommend at least 150-300
minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week, and to strengthen
muscles, bones and joints through different activities, at moderate or
vigorous intensity, at least two days a week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this number sounds daunting, it's not just you -- the <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/others/resources-and-statistics/nphs-2023" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>National Population Health Survey 2023</u></a> revealed
that roughly one in five Singapore residents (21.5%) did not engage in
sufficient total physical activity. The most popular New Year’s resolution
in Singapore, according to a <a href="https://sg.yougov.com/consumer/articles/48336-what-are-singaporeans-top-new-year-resolutions-for-2024" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>2024 survey by YouGov</u></a>,
is improving physical health (you can read our article on science-backed

<p>Exercise snacks can help us reduce sedentary behaviour and sprinkle a
bit more exercise throughout our day. You don’t need to change into fancy
gym clothes and carve out time for a lengthy fitness class to start seeing
results.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://longevity.stanford.edu/lifestyle/2024/07/02/what-are-exercise-snacks-and-why-are-they-important/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Stanford Lifestyle Medicine blog post</u></a> featuring
Dr. Marily Oppezzo, certified personal trainer and head of Stanford Lifestyle
Medicine Healthful Nutrition pillar, recent research even indicates that
"exercise snacks performed throughout the day may be more beneficial than
a one-hour stint at the gym after sitting all day."</p>
<p>As an informal experiment, I decided to try out exercise snacking for
a few days to see what effect they would have, if any, on my overall mood
and energy levels. I set a timer every one or two hours where possible
to do two minutes of wall pushups, squats, or other movements to get my
heart pumping.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dragging myself from my work computer to go take an exercise snack was
difficult at first, but I started looking forward to these mini-workouts.
I alternated between wall pushups, squats, and jumping jacks. Getting my
blood flowing actually made me more productive. I suggest stretching and
warming up before going all in though–I nearly hurt my ankle going straight
from sitting to doing jumping jacks!</p>
