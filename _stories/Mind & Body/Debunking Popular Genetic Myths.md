<p>When I was volunteering at my neighbourhood community garden, my fellow
gardener asked if I could create genetically engineered plants. I told
her that I am a genetic counsellor, which means I interact with humans,
not plants. Even if I were a plant geneticist, what they were asking for
would require more than a handful of garden tools!</p>
<p>Genetic counsellors are healthcare professionals with expertise in human
genetics. We interpret genetic risks based on individuals’ medical and
family histories and educate them on often-complex information in an understandable
manner. We also provide emotional support along the way.</p>
<p>Did I always know that I wanted to be a genetic counsellor? Not at all.
But my fascination for genetics began when I learned to solve genetics-related
questions while preparing for my PSLE and O-Levels. I also was lucky that
my school brought us on field trips to Science Centre Singapore. From an
early age, it was ingrained into me that science was cool and worth pursuing
as a career. As a certified genetic counsellor now, this <em>Void Deck </em>article
is my humble attempt to give back to the Science Centre and spread enthusiasm
for biology and genetics.</p>
<p>As a professional who interacts with people daily, I have heard my fair
share of genetics myths, some of which this article will hopefully debunk.</p>
<p>First, let’s start with the basics. Most cells in our body contain a nucleus
(a.k.a the “brain” of the cell). The nucleus contains a chemical called
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), which serves as our body’s instruction manual.
DNA contains genes, which are like chapters in this instruction manual.
Genes influence traits, like eye colour. Spelling errors in this instruction
manual, referred to as mutations from this point, may influence the risk
of a disease. DNA also contains regions called noncoding sequences that
don’t directly influence traits.</p>
<p>Moving on, let’s examine some common myths and misconceptions related
to genetics.</p>
<h4><strong>Myth #1: Genetic conditions are more common in Western populations.</strong></h4>
<p>When I told my folks that I wanted to become a genetic counsellor, their
impression was: “What is a genetic counsellor and who goes to one anyway?”</p>
<p>No doubt, people don’t go to a genetic counsellor as frequently as they
visit a general practitioner. A recent Singapore-based <a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/OP-24-00858" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">study</a> from
a public health cluster found that of 10, 000 patients who would have been
eligible for cancer-specific genetic counselling, only about 1700 were
referred to the cancer genetics clinic.</p>
<p>Many people feel this way partly because genetic <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7614889/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">research</a> has
historically involved people of European ancestry. As a result, knowledge
of how genetic conditions impact other ancestries has remained limited.</p>
<p>To further perpetuate this misconception, the Angelina Jolie effect happened
in 2013.</p>
<p>In a 2020 Singapore-based <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7585213/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">study</a> that
explored the information individuals hoped to have while pursuing genetic
testing, a participant mentioned that Angelina Jolie created more awareness
about genetic testing than anyone else. The Hollywood actress has been
vocal about her genetic testing journey, which helped her learn that she
had a <em>BRCA1</em> gene mutation.</p>
<p>Individuals with <em>BRCA1</em> gene mutations have a higher lifetime risk
of developing breast, ovarian, pancreatic, prostate and other cancers.
Detection of the <em>BRCA1</em> gene mutation gives the individual the chance
to undergo early and/or more stringent screening as well as risk-reducing
surgeries, such as a double mastectomy, even before cancer develops. And
if cancer is indeed detected, medical intervention (e.g. surgery) can be
performed in a timely manner, possibly leading to better patient survival
and outcomes. Individuals with such gene mutations typically will have
detailed discussions with their clinical team to develop a personalised
medical management plan.</p>
<p>The Angelina Jolie effect seemingly led to genetic testing becoming a
Western medical trend. However, that <em>BRCA1</em> gene mutations – or any
other genetic condition, for that matter – are a “Western disease” is far
from the truth.</p>
<p>For example, in a 2003 <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12872263/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">study</a> involving 49
Singaporean breast cancer patients, <em>BRCA1</em> gene mutations were detected
in 6 individuals. The authors discussed that specific <em>BRCA1</em> gene
mutations likely occurred in some individuals a long time ago (such “ancient”
mutations are called founder mutations) and got transmitted through the
generations.</p>
<p>As humans, regardless of our ancestry, all of us have genes. As a result,
any of us could have a genetic mutation.</p>
<h4><strong>Myth #2: Genetic testing can accurately tell me what my ancestry is.</strong></h4>
<p>Millennials and Gen Z have probably seen YouTube videos of people claiming
“I did my ancestry testing!” or “I can’t believe my ancestry testing results!”
Have you been tempted to try ancestry testing?</p>
<p>To my earlier point on genetic research being mainly focused on European
populations, we are <a href="https://now.tufts.edu/2018/01/26/pulling-back-curtain-dna-ancestry-tests" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">not at the stage</a> where
we know a great deal about non-European ancestries. This means that people
of non-European backgrounds, who make up majority of our island nation,
are probably not going to get the most accurate or reproducible results.
To complicate matters, in an ethnically diverse society like ours where
many individuals identify as multi- or biracial, ancestry testing results
could challenge people’s long-held understanding of their ethnic identities.</p>
<p>There is a lot to unpack on this subject, which is perhaps best reserved
for a future article. For now, suffice it to say that you should consider
taking your ancestry testing results with a grain of salt. In fact, our
Ministry of Health has recommended <a href="https://www.healthwatch.moh.gov.sg/dtc-genetic-tests" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">exercising caution</a> against
direct-to-consumer tests (i.e. tests directly purchased by customers without
involving a genetics professional), including ancestry testing.</p>
<h4><strong>Myth #3: “I look like my Mom, and so I will also develop the same disease as her.”</strong></h4>
<p>Most of us have probably heard a well-meaning aunty or uncle comment that
we look more like our Mom or Dad at a family gathering. It’s most natural;
in fact, the older I get, the more frequently I make those judgments myself.
This is why people often assume that they will develop the same disease(s)
as the parent they resemble more.</p>
<p>We inherit 50% of our genes from our mother and father each, which I refer
to as the 50:50 rule. Many obvious features (e.g. skin colour or height)
are controlled by multiple genes. By pure chance, you might look more like
your mom or dad depending on the combination of genes you get from each
parent.</p>
<p>In contrast, most genetic diseases are controlled by just one (or a few)
specific gene(s). Going by the 50:50 rule, if a parent has a mutation in
a disease-causing gene, there is a 50% chance that they will pass it on
to each child <a href="https://www.singhealth.com.sg/symptoms-treatments/lynch-syndrome" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">independent</a> of
the genes that control physical features. In other words, even if you look
more like your mother, if your father has a disease-causing<em> </em>gene
mutation, there is a 50% chance that you inherited it from him (and vice
versa!).&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Myth #4: Female cancer genetic risks are only passed down to daughters.</strong></h4>
<p>As a genetic counsellor working in oncology, I hear this often from concerned
patients.</p>
<p>Let’s re-visit the case of <em>BRCA1</em>. Males and females naturally
are born with this gene; it protects our cells from developing into cancer
cells. Mutations in <em>BRCA1</em> mean that this gene cannot do its usual
cancer-protective job, which causes an increased risk for <a href="https://www.nccs.com.sg/our-specialties/cancer-genetics-service/hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-syndrome" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">several cancers</a>.
1 in 400 people worldwide have a <em><a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/genetics/brca-fact-sheet" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">BRCA1</a></em>
<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/genetics/brca-fact-sheet" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">gene mutation</a>.</p>
<p>Since males and females are born with the <em>BRCA1</em> gene, mutations
can be present in either sex. Males and females are equally likely to pass
down a <em>BRCA1</em> gene mutation to their son or daughter. The <a href="https://www.nccs.com.sg/our-specialties/cancer-genetics-service/hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-syndrome" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">cancers</a> that
develop due to this mutation <a href="https://curiegenetics.sg/wp-content/uploads/CG_HBOCBrochure.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">vary by sex</a> –
for example, ovarian cancer would arise only in females and prostate cancer
in males, but the mutation <em>per se</em> is <a href="https://www.basser.org/sites/default/files/documents/2023-07/Black%20and%20BRCA%20Common%20Myths_0.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">passed down</a> from
parent to child regardless of sex.</p>
<p>This means that a female with breast cancer concerned about genetic risks
should also be thinking of her sons, not just daughters.</p>
<h4><strong>Myth #5: Genetic mutations can skip a generation.</strong></h4>
<p>I can see how people arrive at this conclusion, because in some families,
diseases appear to happen for the first time in someone, or in a distant
relative.</p>
<p>As discussed in a <a href="https://www.health365.sg/dna-test-for-stomach-cancer-5-myths-and-facts/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Health365.sg article</a>,
it is a common belief that you might not need genetic testing because no
one else the family has had cancer. Along those lines, people might observe
that “cancer skips a generation” in their family, and therefore, conclude
that they might not need genetic testing.</p>
<p>If you noticed, in this article, I always used the word “risk” when discussing
the possibility of disease arising due to a genetic mutation. If a genetic
mutation is present in a person, there is a 50:50 chance that it gets transmitted
to the next generation. However, the presence of a mutation doesn’t automatically
mean that people might develop a disease like cancer.</p>
<p>For example, a <em>BRCA1</em> gene mutation leads to a greater than 60%
– not 100% – lifetime <em>chance</em> of developing breast cancer. Due to
various factors (such as environment, lifestyle, etc.), someone with a <em>BRCA1</em> gene
mutation might never develop cancer. However, this person still has a 50%
chance of <a href="https://www.singhealth.com.sg/symptoms-treatments/lynch-syndrome" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">passing it down</a> to
each of their children. Consequently, one of their children who inherits
the mutation might develop cancer. This causes diseases like cancer to
appear as though they are skipping a generation.</p>
<p>If we look closely, though, the genetic mutations are still being transmitted
through generations, but whether someone ultimately develops a disease
is person-specific.</p>
<p>Of note, there are some genetic mutations that lead to a nearly 100% chance
of developing diseases like Huntington’s Disease. In genetics, context
is important. Always consult with a genetic counsellor, medical geneticist
or other qualified genetics professional if in doubt!</p>
<p>Genetic testing has gained immense popularity in recent years, which has
brought with it a barrage of myths and misconceptions. With precision medicine
(treatments tailored to an individual's unique genomic, environmental,
and lifestyle information) <a href="https://www.edb.gov.sg/en/business-insights/insights/precision-medicine-in-singapore-how-are-global-biomedical-sciences-players-advancing-cancer-treatment-and-personalised-healthcare.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">entering the spotlight</a>,
genetics is likely to play an increasingly important role in routine healthcare.
It is for this exact reason that genetic literacy is important – to understand
our genetic risks correctly, scientifically-sound knowledge is crucial.
Fortunately, professionals, science communicators and organisations like
the Science Centre have been hard at work developing <a href="https://www.science.edu.sg/for-schools/specialized-programmes/dna-learning-lab" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">resources</a> that
demystify this complex subject. As with any science, we must remember to
do our research and consult with experts before arriving at conclusions.</p>
