<p>What are your New Year's resolutions? In 2024, <a href="https://sg.yougov.com/consumer/articles/48336-what-are-singaporeans-top-new-year-resolutions-for-2024" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>YouGov</u></a> reported
that 61% of Singapore residents wanted to improve their physical health,
while 53% included managing money better on their resolution list. Whether
it's finally hitting the gym or curbing spending on bubble tea, psychology
and behavioural science can help you get a science-backed start to 2025.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>The Fresh Start Effect</strong></h4>
<p>You've probably heard the phrase "new year, new you." Behavioral scientists
call this drive to achieve personal growth following temporal landmarks
the <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/4000-mondays/202412/fresh-starts-the-psychology-behind-new-year-motivation?msockid=0e9b106fe0af61863b7b04eae1ea6015" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>fresh start effect</u></a>.
This <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2014.1901a" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>effect</u></a>,
described by behavioral scientists Hengchen Dai, Katherine Milkman, and
Jason Riis, is the tendency for people to feel extra motivation following
key dates like a birthday or new year to chase their dreams. Since the
special occasion indicates a “<a href="https://www.thebehavioralscientist.com/glossary/fresh-start-effect" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>psychological reset</u></a>,”
people feel like they can begin with a clean slate.</p>
<p>While the New Year is perhaps the biggest example of this, you can take
advantage of the "fresh start effect" anytime. Technically, what we benchmark
as New Year's Day in the Western world (January 1 in the Gregorian calendar),
<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/calendar-new-year-celebrations-around-world" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>isn't a universal rule </u>
</a>for the start of the year. Several Asian traditions celebrate the new
year based on different calendars; for example, Chinese New Year occurs
on the <a href="https://lammuseum.wfu.edu/education/teachers/chinese-new-year/history-of-chinese-new-year/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>second new moon following the winter solstice</u></a>,
while Deepavali takes place on <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/calendar-new-year-celebrations-around-world" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">amavasya (new moon) usually between mid-October to mid-November</a> based
on the Hindu lunisolar calendar. There are opportunities for fresh starts
anywhere you look, even with something as simple as a new week if you treat
it like a new beginning.</p>
<h4><strong>Smarter Goal Setting</strong></h4>
<p>To milk the benefits of that psychological boost around a fresh start,
introspect and identify what exactly you want to achieve. Beginning in
the 1960s, psychologists <a href="https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&amp;&amp;p=612520324d8124e1cf5704ef6c1f599440c87a3d52f95068bd2eea6088e07256JmltdHM9MTczNjI5NDQwMA&amp;ptn=3&amp;ver=2&amp;hsh=4&amp;fclid=0e9b106f-e0af-6186-3b7b-04eae1ea6015&amp;psq=Edwin+Locke+and+Gary+Latham+goal+setting+theory&amp;u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly9tZWQuc3RhbmZvcmQuZWR1L2NvbnRlbnQvZGFtL3NtL3Mtc3BpcmUvZG9jdW1lbnRzL1BELmxvY2tlLWFuZC1sYXRoYW0tcmV0cm9zcGVjdGl2ZV9QYXBlci5wZGY&amp;ntb=1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Edwin Locke and Gary Latham</u></a> began
researching goal-setting in corporate environments. Their research trickled
down to the formation of consultant <a href="https://www.projectsmart.co.uk/smart-goals/brief-history-of-smart-goals.php" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>George Doran's highly popular S.M.A.R.T. goal acronym</u></a> (Specific,
Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound). In recent years, though,
some experts have recommended setting more <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/slipping-on-your-new-years-resolutions-science-tips-to-get-on-track/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>open-ended goals</u></a>,
especially if you're just picking up a new skill, since identifying a suitably
challenging goal requires some experience. Open goals, such as just walking
more versus walking 5 km every day, might be more encouraging and exploratory
for beginners.</p>
<p>If you do have some experience in the area where you want to improve,
though, the power of setting a numerical target shouldn't be overlooked.
One example is how many marathon runners set a goal of running a marathon
in less than four hours. <a href="https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2417" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">A study published in </a><em><a href="https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2417" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Management Science</a></em>
<a href="https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2417" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"></a>gathered data from 10 million marathon runners and found that a lot
more runners "finish in three hours and 59 minutes rather than four hours
and one minute," suggesting that setting such targets can help drive better
performance.</p>
<p>Reframing a negative habit you want to kick as a <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-science-behind-building-healthy-habits-can-help-you-keep-your-new-years-resolution-219947" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>positive habit</u></a> you
want to foster may also lead to success. For instance, you could reframe
"stop being sedentary" as "take a 15-minute stroll after dinner each day."
A <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0234097" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>2020 study</u></a> found
that people who framed their New Year's resolutions as approach-oriented
goals (introducing positive behaviours) were significantly more successful
than those who framed their resolutions as avoidance-oriented goals, with
58.9% of approach-oriented participants achieving their goal compared to
47.1% of the avoidance-oriented participants.</p>
<h4><strong>Be Kind to Yourself</strong></h4>
<p>And if you're already struggling with your New Year's resolutions, don't
despair. You're not alone. Shockingly, research reveals that as many as

</a>of people give up on their resolutions by February. Some <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/what-mentally-strong-people-dont-do/202412/why-new-years-resolutions-set-you-up-to-fail?msockid=0e9b106fe0af61863b7b04eae1ea6015" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>common reasons resolutions fail</u></a> are
that they are either ill-defined or too vague, depend on all-or-nothing
approaches, lack structural support, and are results of external pressure
rather than intrinsically motivated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Psychologists recommend focusing on the big picture of gradual improvement
and adopting a <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/what-mentally-strong-people-dont-do/202412/why-new-years-resolutions-set-you-up-to-fail?msockid=0e9b106fe0af61863b7b04eae1ea6015" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>self-compassionate attitude</u></a> instead
of immediately berating yourself for experiencing a setback with your goal.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/what-mentally-strong-people-dont-do/202412/why-new-years-resolutions-set-you-up-to-fail?msockid=0e9b106fe0af61863b7b04eae1ea6015" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Adapting </u></a>after
bingeing potato chips could mean going back and setting up a smaller, more
reasonably challenging goal for yourself (e.g. chomp on baked nuts instead
of junk food during late night cravings), or realizing that you need to
set up your environment in a different way to foster success (e.g. grocery
shopping when you’re not hungry and preparing healthier pantry options
in advance). As psychotherapist Amy Morin writes in her blog post for Psychology
Today, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/what-mentally-strong-people-dont-do/202412/why-new-years-resolutions-set-you-up-to-fail?msockid=0e9b106fe0af61863b7b04eae1ea6015" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>"hugely successful people approach failure as feedback, not the end."</u></a>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Have Fun!</strong></h4>
<p>This iterative process of self-discovery can even be fun. People are turning
to more creative and playful alternatives to the traditional New Year's
resolution list in recent years, for example, crafting <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Wellness/make-vision-board-reach-goals-new-year-neurologist/story?id=105991569" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>vision boards</u></a>,
poster collages of pictures representing one's aspirations. Neurologist
Dr. Leah Croll reports looking at these vision boards encourages <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Wellness/make-vision-board-reach-goals-new-year-neurologist/story?id=105991569" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>visualization</u></a>,
which can help train your brain since <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Wellness/make-vision-board-reach-goals-new-year-neurologist/story?id=105991569" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>“visualizing a desired outcome can activate the same neural pathways as actually experiencing it.”</u></a>
</p>
<p>Another joyful take on the New Year's resolution is the recent TikTok
trend of creating <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/wellness/never-stick-to-new-years-resolutions-tiktoks-bingo-card-theory-might-just-help/ar-AA1wHBaj?ocid=BingNewsSerp" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>bingo cards</u></a>.
You fill in bingo card squares with small goals you want to achieve over
the year, and “play” with your friends and family to see who can cross
off all their squares first. This practice can help overcome the all-or-nothing
thinking that often dooms New Year's resolutions, while introducing social
accountability, flexibility, and fun so achieving that goal doesn't seem
like a daunting checklist anymore.</p>
<p>As for myself, this is my third year in a row where getting enough sleep
is on my New Year's resolutions list (you can read my <a href="/pokemon-sleep" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">2024 New Year's experiment with gamifying sleep</a> here).
However, as opposed to feeling disheartened when I inevitably end up watching
an entire Netflix series in one night, I'll change things up this year
by being more curious and setting myself up for smaller but more doable
sleep wins. Here's to making 2025 your year!</p>
