<p>Stepping into Science Centre Singapore, you are immediately greeted with
<a href="https://www.science.edu.sg/whats-on/exhibitions/the-mind-s-eye" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">The Mind's Eye</a>, one of our staple exhibits. Even as a kid, I could
vividly remember the wall of Albert Einstein Hollow-Face Illusions, staring
into my soul.</p>
<p>Now as an adult, optical illusions continue to amaze and boggle me, but
the science behind them has always escaped me. There are many kinds of
optical illusions, but I have chosen to break down four everyday illusions
that we experience in our everyday lives.</p>
<h4><strong>1. The Dress</strong></h4>
<p>We all remember The Dress. A widely circulated photo of a seemingly plain
looking dress, that ended up sparking fierce online debates – is the dress
white and gold or black and blue?</p>
<p>It became such a viral phenomenon and internet meme there’s even a substantial
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_dress" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Wikipedia page about it</a>. Unfortunately, five years after upending
the field, vision scientists still lack a full scientific consensus on
how this happened.</p>
<p>The main theory is that the photo is contextually ambiguous – there are
hardly any clues about if it was taken indoors or outdoors, and whether
the dress is backlit or frontlit. These are actually important cues for
our vision – without them, our brains are forced to make sense of what
we see by making assumptions.</p>
<p>If we assume the photo to be taken in natural light or the dress as being
in the shadow, we’d be more inclined to see the photo as white and gold
as our brains automatically discount the blue light of daylight or shadows.
Discounting the gold light would result in seeing it as black and blue,
which is the actual colour of the dress.</p>

<p><em>The image processing part of our brain relies heavily on its context.</em>
</p>
<h4><strong>2. Moving Images</strong></h4>
<p>Stare at a moving escalator for too long and you’ll likely experience
the<strong> motion aftereffect</strong>. This moving illusion can be seen
after staring at a moving visual for some time, and shifting your attention
to a stationary visual. The stationary visual seems to be moving in the <em>opposite direction </em>from
the moving visual.</p>
<p>This effect demonstrates our brain’s capacity for <em>motion adaptation</em>.</p>
<p>One theory is that the neurons in the brain involved in processing moving
images become fatigued from the constant moving image, and unable to balance
the sudden change when we look away, causing other neurons to falsely signal
motion in the other direction.</p>
<p>Try staring at the spiral for about 20 seconds, and then stare at the
dots.</p>

<h4><strong>3. Sydney Opera House Illusion</strong></h4>
<p>The next illusion is a fun one. To witness the<strong> Sydney Opera House Illusion</strong>,
look out the window of the room you’re in and focus your eyes on a faraway
building. As you step further and further away from the window, you will
observe the object (represented here by the iconic Merlion!) appearing
to grow larger and larger in size.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/merlion_higherquality.gif">
</div>
<p>As the distant building grows to take up the whole frame of the window,
it starts to look freakishly large. This works as our brains tend to use
surrounding objects as a reference frame, and greatly influences our perception
of objects.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Optical_Illusions_Merlion_Room_Comparison_1.jpg">
</div>
<p>Examples of relative size illusions like these are common. When the moon
hangs low in the horizon, it looks huge next to the surrounding buildings.
Yet, when it is up high, the moon appears tiny in the large expanse of
dark sky. Instead of providing regular sized plates, buffet restaurants
tend to provide smaller plates, as a way of tricking patrons into feeling
fuller faster with less food.</p>

</p>
<p>What’s curious about illusions like these (Ebbinghaus illusions) is that
we are not born to be fooled by them. A <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20712737/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">2010 study</a> found that
children under the age of 10 are less permeable to its effect, and it is
believed that we grow more context sensitive over time.</p>
<h4><strong>4. Looking into another dimension</strong></h4>
<p>You might not have heard of an autostereogram, but you’ve most likely
tried out a Magic Eye picture illusion. Our eyes can perceive 3D shapes
within these flat pictures because of their incredible ability to line
up two images to interpret depth.</p>
<p>Can you see the shapes in the Magic Eye picture below?</p>

</p>
<p>One way that our brain perceives depth is through our binocular vision,
using the two similar but slightly different visuals from both eyes. This
is known as stereopsis. The differences in angles between the two visuals
give away their depth – objects closer to us look very different to our
left and right eyes, while far away objects look almost identical.</p>
<p>Autostereograms appear to be a regular repeating pattern at first glance,
but the repeating elements actually have slightly different distances between
them. Our brains have difficulty lining up patterns when they are repeated
horizontally, and you can trick your brain into lining up the patterns
by ‘looking behind’ it. The difference in distances allows your brain to
perceive various depths, causing these elements to ‘jump out’ of the image.</p>
<p>This is also how 3D movies and Virtual Reality (VR) are perceived by our
eyes from 2D images! Magic eye pictures are so-called <em>auto</em>stereograms,
as they do not require the use of stereoscopes like 3D glasses or a VR
headset.</p>
<p>Not everyone is able to see it – if you can’t, try decoding the hidden
shapes with <a href="http://magiceye.ecksdee.co.uk/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">magiceye.ecksdee.co.uk</a>.</p>
<p>Optical illusions are also seen as a form of art, and it’s not difficult
to see why it is so. Competitions are held for such visual artists of all
mediums, and one of my favourites is <a href="https://www.instagram.com/designdain/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Dain Yoon</a>, an immaculate
makeup artist and painter.</p>
<p>Finally, my fascination with optical illusions is strongly tied to what
I think they teach us.</p>
<p>Through revealing the blind spots of our body, optical illusions teach
us about our body’s weaknesses. I love that it humbles us, knowing that
there is still much to uncover about one of our key senses! Illusions also
remind us to be empathetic, as everything we see (literally and metaphorically)
is a matter of perception, and that we all look through a biased lens.</p>
