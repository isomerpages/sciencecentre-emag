<p>Planning your wellness goals for 2024? My New Year’s resolution is to
average seven hours of sleep a night, <a href="https://www.healthhub.sg/live-healthy/sleep" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">the minimum amount recommended for adults 18-64 years old</a> by
the National Sleep Foundation. To help me to get more sleep, I tried Pokémon
Sleep for two weeks to see if the smartphone game could supercharge my
slumber.</p>

<h4><strong>How Pokémon Sleep Works</strong></h4>

<p>Pokémon Sleep is a sleep tracker app for Android and iOS users released
by The Pokémon Company in late July 2023. Similar to how Pokémon Go <a href="https://gizmodo.com/pokemon-sleep-review-cozy-game-rest-snorlax-go-1850652225" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">“gamified walking”</a> by
encouraging players to roam around their cities to catch location-specific
Pokémon, Pokémon Sleep aims to support healthier lifestyles by <a href="https://press.pokemon.com/en/releases/MEDIA-ALERT-Pokemon-Sleep-Now-Available" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">“[turning] sleep into entertainment.</a>”
The popular app reached <a href="https://press.pokemon.com/en/releases/Pokemon-Sleep-Celebrates-Ten-Million-Downloads" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">10 million downloads</a> in
late August 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The game’s premise is that you are a researcher helping Professor Neroli
understand Snorlax’s ability to put nearby Pokémon to sleep. During the
day, you work with the Professor to raise a cuddly Snorlax by feeding it
berries and meals to increase its Drowsy Power. When it’s time to go to
bed, you place your smartphone or a Pokémon GO Plus + Bluetooth device
next to your pillow and turn on sleep mode.</p>
<p>Throughout the night, the app uses your phone’s accelerometer to track
your body movements and estimate your sleep duration and quality. The more
sleep you track, the higher your sleep score. Your sleep score is then
multiplied by your Snorlax’s Drowsy Power, and the higher the resulting
number is, the more Pokémon appear around your campsite the next morning
for you to add to your Sleepdex.</p>
<p>Every week you get the chance to grow a new Snorlax on a new research
site. Rack up data on Pokémon sleep styles in your Sleepdex and you can
unlock idyllic islands like Snowdrop Tundra or Cyan Beach to discover new
Pokémon.</p>

<h4><strong>Sleepless in Singapore</strong></h4>

<p>Unfortunately, our real-life island nation is not as relaxing as the game’s
landscapes. In fact, Singapore consistently ranks among the worst countries
in the world when it comes to sleep.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.singhealth.com.sg/news/others/sleep-deprived-but%20still-sleeping-on-it" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">2014 survey</a> by
Jawbone, Singapore ranked the third most sleep-deprived city out of 43
cities, trailing behind Tokyo and Seoul. Based on the <a href="https://www.philips.com.sg/a-w/about/news/archive/standard/news/press/2021/20211703-philips-global-sleep-study-finds-singaporeans-sleep-woes-compounded-by-pandemic-yet-more-turning-to-telehealth-for-help.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Philips 2021 global sleep survey</a>,
Singaporeans averaged 6.8 hours of sleep a night. In 2022, a <a href="https://business.yougov.com/content/41611-singaporeans-would-sleep-least-seven-hours-only-qu" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">YouGov survey</a> concluded
that “only one in four people in Singapore (27%) have an ideal sleep cycle
(of 7 hours or more).”</p>
<p>To better understand the state of Singapore’s sleep deprivation, I talked
with Professor Michael Chee, Director of Centre for Sleep and Cognition
at the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore.
Prof. Chee identified Singapore’s intense work culture and test-driven
academic pressure as key socio-cultural factors impacting sleep for working
adults and students in Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2023.08.010" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">In a research paper published in </a><em><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2023.08.010" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Sleep Medicine </a></em>
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2023.08.010" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">last year</a>, Prof. Chee and a team of researchers from the Centre for
Sleep and Cognition assessed sleep data from over 220,000 users of the
Oura Ring, a consumer sleep tracker, across 35 countries. They found that
<a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2023/08/230829130004.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">“people in Asia have shorter sleep …and lower sleep efficiency”</a>than
people in Europe, Oceania and North America. The team hypothesized that
work culture differences impact sleeping patterns.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prof. Chee compared long working hours in Asian countries like Singapore
with different social norms towards work in other countries. “In parts
of Europe where they sleep more, like in France, they have actually got
legislation against contacting workers post-office hours for work reasons,”
Prof. Chee explained. In contrast, East Asian societies normalize highly
demanding schedules. For example, “in China, they have the 996 culture,
[working] 9am to 9pm, 6 days.”</p>
<p>While Prof. Chee recognizes the difficulties of obtaining adequate sleep
under these work conditions, he stresses that “you need to invest—just
as you invest money and invest the time in developing your career—in your
health and mental well being.”</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>The Two Week Challenge</strong></h4>
<p>Determined to fix my sleep habits, I decided to test if Pokémon Sleep
would incentivize me to sleep earlier and longer. I’ve tried various fitness
watches, meditation apps, and sleep tracker wristbands to improve my sleep,
but never a game. As a Pokémon fan, I was eager to see if the reward of
collecting cute Pokémon would help me rest more peacefully.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To stay accountable, one of my colleagues joined me on the two week challenge
and we added each other as friends through the Pokémon Sleep “Research
Community” feature. Since we could see each other’s daily sleep scores,
this gave me extra incentive to sleep more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first night was somewhat of a failure. Since the phone needs to be
on the mattress with the application open to track your sleep, I hopped
into bed with my mobile device in hand just before midnight. Instead of
pressing the button to start my sleep session right away, I ended up
<a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/07/doomscrolling-mental-health-covid19-sleep/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">doom scrolling</a>on Instagram until 2:00 AM before finally initiating
sleep tracking on the app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The need to keep the phone nearby is probably my biggest issue with Pokémon
Sleep’s design. Most sleep guidelines suggest <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/every-mind-matters/mental-wellbeing-tips/how-to-fall-asleep-faster-and-sleep-better/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">decreasing night-time electronics use</a>,
since the blue light from screens interferes with our body’s biological
clock and how we produce melatonin, a hormone that plays a role in sleep.
The application needs to be running for the tracking to work, and although
the phone can be face down, the temptation to reach over and watch YouTube
or answer texts is real.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite these flaws, I appreciated how the app made sleep tracking fun,
magical, and interactive. The joy of discovering new Pokémon sleep styles
the next morning, like Charmander’s Crackling Sleep or Mareep’s Fluffy
Sleep, did motivate me to regularize my sleep schedule. (You get extra
bonuses and rewards if you stick to a consistent bedtime and wake-up time,
attracting new snoozing Pokémon.)</p>

<p>The <em>kawaii </em>animation and nostalgic music further enhanced the
game’s soothing qualities. I got a little sleepy just watching my Snorlax
slumbering away and yawning every few seconds.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/sleep_deprivation_05.jpg">
</div>
<p>While my colleague couldn’t be bothered to feed Snorlax to increase its
Drowsy Power, I enjoyed concocting smoothies, pies, and curries in the
game during the day. As the food was cooking, a pop-up screen would appear
with bite-sized advice on how to improve sleep. These pointers were adapted
from consultations with pioneering sleep researcher <a href="https://corporate.pokemon.co.jp/en/topics/detail/110.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Dr. Masashi Yanagisawa</a>,
President and CEO of S’UIMIN Inc., providing nice edutainment value.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/sleep_deprivation_06.jpg">
</div>
<p>Perhaps the best part of the game is that it visualizes your sleep data
in a lighthearted and engaging way. Each morning you receive a graph of
your <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/pokemon-sleep/How_to_Get_Each_Sleep_Type" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">sleep styles</a>,
from “dozing” (lots of tossing and turning), to “snoozing” (some movement
or snoring), and “slumbering” (deep sleep with little noise). Your dominant
sleep style will then attract Pokémon who sleep in the same way. For example,
after one particularly restless night, the pig monkey Pokémon Mankey appeared
at my campsite in Angry Sleep.</p>
<p>The report even includes audio recordings from the night before, which
are a little embarrassing but illuminating. My audio recordings revealed
I scratched a lot in my sleep, irritated by rashes; my colleague was amazed
and aghast to hear herself grinding her teeth, which made her make an appointment
with a dentist.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

</div>
<p>Although I suspect Pokémon Sleep is less precise than other sleep trackers,
the upside is that the free app makes it enjoyable to keep an eye on how
much shuteye you’re getting.</p>
<p>And yes<strong>—</strong>over the two weeks, my informal experiment recorded
some improvements.</p>
<p>My average daily sleep score (amount of time asleep) went from 68 points
in the first week to 73 points in the second week. Meanwhile, my sleep
consistency score (how regular my sleep routine was) jumped from a C in
the first week to an A in the second week. Overall, my average daily sleep
increased from 5 hours and 49 minutes in the first week to 6 hours and
11 minutes in the second week. That’s 22 precious minutes!</p>

<h4><strong>For Kids?</strong></h4>
<p>After my successful sleep challenge, I was curious about the game’s potential
to help children learn good sleep habits. The kid-friendly graphics are
a huge draw and Pokémon Sleep even adjusts its gameplay for young players.
For example, players who are 15 years old and under need to sleep at least
11 hours to achieve the maximum sleep score of 100,&nbsp; which game designers
based on the <a href="https://www.pokemonsleep.net/en/science/support01/#section02" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">guidelines from American pediatrics</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To explore if Pokémon Sleep could be a parenting tool, I communicated
over email with Assistant Professor June Chi-Yan Lo from the Centre for
Sleep and Cognition at the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University
of Singapore. Asst. Prof. Lo has researched extensively on sleep health
and neurobehavioral functions in children and adolescents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Asst. Prof. Lo noted that the game’s benchmark of 11 hours of sleep every
night is considered “may be appropriate” only for older teens as “<a href="https://www.thensf.org/how-many-hours-of-sleep-do-you-really-need/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">the National Sleep Foundation </a>recommends
children aged 6 to 13 years and adolescents aged 14 to 17 years to sleep
9 to 11 and 8 to 10 hours respectively.”</p>
<p>According to Asst. Prof. Lo, Pokémon Sleep “may make it fun for children
to get more sleep,” and could provide a “good way for parents to change
their children’s sleep timing in addition to following basic sleep hygiene.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, she observes that “young children may not have their own phone”
and “notifications and messages received in the middle of the night may
disrupt sleep if the phone is placed next to their pillow or bed and not
switched to Do Not Disturb mode.” Furthermore, “some children may be tempted
to use the phone or app during their sleep hours if it is placed in their
bedroom,” she says. (Much like adults.)</p>
<p><strong>Cannot Defeat Biology</strong>
</p>
<p>The Pokémon franchise is well known for epic battles. As I approached
the end of the two week challenge, I was reminded of Prof. Chee’s description
of sleep deprivation as “a slow fuse time bomb,” “one that will blow up
because you basically cannot defeat biology.” As he emphasizes, sleep is
“a biological imperative” that Singaporeans are all too experienced trying
in vain to overcome.</p>
<p>To quote from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyq7IGwfOJk" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Pokémon Sleep teaser trailer</a>,
“rest is the strongest healing move—even for humans!” We gotta catch ‘em
z’s if we want to keep happy and healthy in the new year.</p>
