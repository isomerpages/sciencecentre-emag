<p>In a refreshing twist to conventional discussions, Science Centre Singapore's
latest <a href="https://www.science.edu.sg/whats-on/workshops-activities/science-cafe" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Science Café</a> session,
"Bioethics: Charting a Course With Your Moral Compass", held on Friday,
14 March 2025, transformed complex bioethical debates into engaging intellectual
games. Following a buffet dinner and drinks, attendees put our distinguished
speakers to the test, challenging them with bioethics topics through an
innovative guessing game that sparked increasingly meaningful conversations.</p>
<p>Many of us might initially view bioethics as a daunting field, and understandably
so. It often presents us with scenarios where there's no clear right or
wrong—only difficult choices between competing values. The real challenge
lies not just in making these decisions but in understanding and justifying
our ethical reasoning. Sometimes, we find ourselves choosing what might
be called the "least problematic option" among challenging alternatives.</p>
<p>We were fortunate to have two leading experts guide us through these ethical
mazes: Dr Voo Teck Chuan, Head of SingHealth Office of Ethics in Healthcare
and Advisor for the SingHealth Duke-NUS Medical Humanities Institute, alongside
Dr Chow Chiu Leung, Senior Consultant Geriatrician at Changi General Hospital
and Co-lead for SingHealth Duke-NUS Medical Humanities Institute in Bioethics.</p>

<p>The evening unfolded through two thought-provoking activities. The first
was a clever word association game where groups contributed unique terms
related to a bioethical topic—with the catch that duplicate submissions
were eliminated. Our speakers then had to deduce the original topic from
these clues, adding an element of playful challenge to serious subjects.</p>

<p>The second activity proved particularly revealing. Participants used voting
cards to express their stance on various ethical scenarios, which grew
progressively more complex. Take, for instance, the seemingly straightforward
question about the ethics of consuming lab-grown meat. The discussion became
more nuanced when considering scenarios like growing meat from one's own
cells for personal consumption. It was fascinating to observe how opinions
shifted as new layers of complexity were introduced.</p>

<p>Both speakers enriched the session with compelling case studies that left
participants deep in thought. They introduced fundamental principles of
clinical ethics, including beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (avoiding
harm), autonomy (respecting patient choices), and justice (balancing individual
needs with societal resources). These principles often come into play in
challenging scenarios where healthcare providers must make difficult decisions
about patient care prioritisation.</p>
