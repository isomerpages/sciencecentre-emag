<h4>The Blood Moon on 3rd March 2026 will also coincide with the 15th day of the Lunar New Year.</h4>
<p>On 3rd March 2026, a total lunar eclipse will be visible in Singapore
skies. But did you know that it's also going to be a <strong>blood moon</strong>?
That's right, the moon will be appearing red. Could this signify a 'huat'
for the year of the horse?</p>
<p>Let's break down the science.</p>
<h4>When do we know if a blood moon is happening? </h4>
<p>To put it simply, all <em>total</em> lunar eclipses are blood moons. This
is very different from a <em>partial</em> lunar eclipse. A total lunar eclipse
occurs when the moon <em>completely</em> enters the Earth's shadow. What
exactly does this mean?</p>
<p>The Sun, Earth and Moon may align itself for every eclipse, but due to
the tilt of the Moon in respect to the Earth, the alignment is not always
a straight line. You may think of the Earth having 2 types of shadow:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>A 'total' shadow where there is minimal light from the sun.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A 'partial' shadow where some light may still reach the moon.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>But why is it turning red?</p>
<p>Sunlight contains all colours. When sunlight passes through Earth's atmosphere,
the shorter wavelengths, such as the blues and greens, scatter away first.
What survives the journey? The longer wavelengths.</p>
<p>Red light has the longest wavelength, which is why it bends through the
atmosphere and gets cast onto the Moon during the total lunar eclipse.
This would not work if the Moon is only passing through the 'partial shadow'
since pure light from the Sun is still reaching the Moon.</p>
<h4>When can you actually see it in Singapore? </h4>
<p>The best time to view it in the night sky is 7:45PM. This is the most
ideal time where the Moon has risen past Singapore's skyline.</p>
<p>Technically the eclipse starts around 6:00PM Singapore time, but it would
have still not risen yet.</p>
<p>For those interested, you can catch Science Centre Singapore's exclusive
<a href="https://for.edu.sg/eclipse" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">livestream</a>on 3rd March 2026, 6:00PM or even head down to the centre
where it will be specially open with festivities.</p>
<h4>Why is this one extra special?</h4>
<p>This eclipse lands on the 15th day of the Lunar New Year. So if you are
the sentimental type, you can consider this the sky's own lantern festival.</p>
