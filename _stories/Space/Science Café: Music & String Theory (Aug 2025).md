<p>Music and physics may conjure up very different images—pianos versus,
say, atoms—but both disciplines share a fascination with vibrations, frequencies,
patterns, scales, and time. Even the ancient Greeks were obsessed with
cosmic harmonies. As <a href="https://www.ams.org/publicoutreach/math-and-music" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Pythagoras</u></a> famously
stated, "There is geometry in the humming of the strings, there is music
in the spacing of the spheres."&nbsp;</p>
<p>To celebrate the interdisciplinary connections between science and the
arts, Science Centre Singapore hosted a Science Café session on Music &amp;
String Theory at the NAFA-UAS Co-learning Space on Friday 22 August 2025
evening in collaboration with Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts and the University
of the Arts Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Attendees enjoyed a buffet dinner and drinks while listening to thought-provoking
talks on string theory and its resonances in music. The event featured
two speakers, particle physics expert Associate Professor Tan Meng-Chwan
from National University of Singapore (Assistant Dean, Outreach and Admissions,
and Head of the NUS String Theory Group) and award-winning composer Dr.
Joyce Koh Beetuan from NAFA, UAS (Associate Dean, School of Interdisciplinary
Arts and Associate Dean, Technology and Sustainability Research, Research
Division).</p>
<p>The session began with fun audience icebreakers led by Science Centre
Singapore staff. A game of string theory bingo included phrases like "loop",
"rhythm", "space-time", “wormhole”, "<em>Stranger Things</em>", and "Marvel",
encouraging attendees to discuss and draw associations between music, popular
culture, and quantum physics.</p>

<p>While string theory may sound very esoteric, you've probably been exposed
to popular media premised on string theory concepts. Several recent Hollywood
films have taken inspiration from string theory's suggestion that multiple
universes exist, from <em>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</em> to <em>Everything Everywhere All At Once</em> and <em>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the most striking examples is a scene from <em>Interstellar</em> where
NASA pilot Joseph Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) falls through a black hole
and ends up in a tesseract, a strange library-like structure created by
advanced beings to represent five dimensions. Using the strings of time,
Cooper is able to manipulate the tesseract to communicate with his daughter,
scientist Murphy Cooper (Bryce Dallas Howard), throughout various periods
of her life back on Earth. Higher dimensions and mind-bending geometries
are just a few tantalising ideas from string theory that have been spotlighted
in popular culture.</p>

<p>In Associate Professor Tan Meng-Chwan's talk, "String Theory: A Flash
Introduction", A/P Prof Tan gave attendees a quick crash-course in why
string theory matters. He described how the standard model of particle
physics accounts for the behaviour of subatomic particles and fundamental
forces except gravity, and how string theory aims to unify gravity and
quantum physics into a single framework.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A/P Prof Tan performed a simple demonstration, holding a line on paper
representing a string at a distance, to model to the audience how "a very,
very short string will look like a point particle" from afar. He explained
that string theory suggests that all these elementary particles are manifestations
of vibrating strings, with infinite possible configurations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A/P Prof Tan described how string theory postulates that “our universe
is actually 10-dimensional” and has led to the conceptualisation of new
mathematical structures, such as Calabi-Yau manifolds representing multidimensional
shapes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[ATTACH PHOTO OF CALABI-YAU MANIFOLDS]</p>
<p>Advanced mathematics serves as a tool to validate string theory in the
absence of experimental verification, as A/P Prof Tan explained “[strings
are] therefore very difficult to detect [experimentally], as you need huge
amounts of energy to smash the quarks into their smaller, constituent strings.”
To illustrate the minute scale of these strings, A/P Prof Tan pointed out
that “the size of a superstring is as much smaller than the atom as the
atom is smaller than the size of the solar system!”</p>

<p>Next, Dr. Joyce Koh Beetuan's talk “In Search of the Music of String Theory”
introduced her perspective as a musician, walking attendees through her
creative process translating scientific theories into sound. She discussed
her early inspirations from science writing such as <em>The Elegant Universe </em>by
Brian Greene and a <a href="https://www.ias.edu/sites/default/files/sns/string(3).pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>2002 article</u></a> in <em>Astronomy </em>by
Edward Witten, which prompted her to wonder about whether she could bring
the one-dimensional strings to life through the strings of musical instruments
like violins. She drew analogies between how vibrations in string theory
produce different elementary particles like electrons, photons, and neutrinos
and how vibrations in musical instruments produce harmonics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[ATTACH PHOTO OF IMPROMPTU VIOLIN AUDIENCE PERFORMANCE]</p>
<p>Using this analogy as the basis for her 2010 multimedia production, <em>On the String</em>,
Dr. Joyce Koh Beetuan set out to imagine what “the music of the universe”
might sound like if “we could hear the sounds of these tiny strings of
energy.” Participants were treated to a short video snippet from <em>On the String</em>,
“a live music performance by 16 musicians, including the pipa and harpsichord,
and two new interactive sound sculptures.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>[ATTACH PHOTO OF ON THE STRING MULTIMEDIA WORK]</p>
<p>Dr. Joyce Koh Beetuan shared behind-the-scenes content from the production,
from early concept sketches of the large sound sculptures, to experimentations
with synthesising sounds using computer simulations to mimic the sounds
of theoretical strings made of various materials from titanium, steel,
plastic, and glass.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Attendees networked and mingled after the talks, connecting with other
science enthusiasts. The Science Café provided participants an opportunity
to ponder the origins of the universe and music’s role in transmitting
the movements of the firmaments. Although string theory remains an incomplete
framework for unifying physics awaiting further technological advancements
and verification, it remains a compelling Theory of Everything pushing
us to reimagine how we make sense of the cosmos.&nbsp;</p>
