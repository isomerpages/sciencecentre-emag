<p>Music and physics may conjure up very different images—pianos versus,
say, atoms—but both disciplines share a fascination with vibrations, frequencies,
patterns, scales, and time. Even the ancient Greeks were obsessed with
cosmic harmonies. An aphorism attributed to <a href="https://www.ams.org/publicoutreach/math-and-music" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Pythagoras</u></a> states,
"There is geometry in the humming of the strings, there is music in the
spacing of the spheres."&nbsp;</p>
<p>To celebrate the interdisciplinary connections between science and the
arts, Science Centre Singapore hosted a Science Café session on Music &amp;
String Theory in collaboration with Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (NAFA)
and the University of the Arts Singapore (UAS) at the NAFA-UAS Co.Learning.Space
on Friday 22 August 2025 evening.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The event featured two speakers, string theory expert Associate Professor
Tan Meng-Chwan from the National University of Singapore (Assistant Dean,
Outreach and Admissions, and Head of the NUS String Theory Group) and award-winning
composer Dr. Joyce Koh Beetuan from NAFA, UAS (Associate Dean, School of
Interdisciplinary Arts and Associate Dean, Technology and Sustainability
Research, Research Division).</p>
<p>Attendees enjoyed a buffet dinner and drinks while listening to thought-provoking
talks on string theory and its resonances in music.</p>

<p>The session began with fun audience icebreakers led by Science Centre
Singapore staff. A game of string theory bingo included phrases like "loop",
"rhythm", "space-time", “wormhole”, "<em>Stranger Things</em>", and "Marvel",
encouraging attendees to draw associations between music, popular culture,
and quantum physics.</p>

</p>
<p>While string theory may sound very esoteric, you've probably been exposed
to popular media premised on string theory concepts. Several recent Hollywood
films have taken inspiration from string theory's suggestion that multiple
universes exist, from <em>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</em> to <em>Everything Everywhere All At Once</em> and <em>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the most striking examples is a scene from <em>Interstellar</em> where
NASA pilot Joseph Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) falls through a black hole
and ends up in a tesseract, a strange library-like structure created by
advanced beings to represent five dimensions. Using the strings of time,
Cooper is able to manipulate the tesseract to communicate with his daughter,
scientist Murphy Cooper (Bryce Dallas Howard), throughout various periods
of her life back on Earth. Higher dimensions and mind-bending geometries
are just a few tantalising ideas from string theory that have been spotlighted
in popular culture, albeit in highly speculative ways.</p>

<p>Building on the icebreakers referencing string theory in popular culture,
Assoc. Prof. Tan's talk "String Theory: A Flash Introduction" provided
attendees a quick crash course in why string theory matters. Assoc. Prof.
Tan described how the standard model of particle physics accounts for the
behaviour of subatomic particles and fundamental forces except gravity.
He explained, "therefore to understand the origin of the universe, we will
need a unified theory of gravity and the standard model of the quantum
world," which is where string theory comes in.</p>

<p><em>Assoc. Prof. Tan presenting his talk "String Theory: A Flash Introduction".</em>
</p>
<p>Assoc. Prof. Tan performed a simple demonstration, holding a line representing
a string drawn on a piece of paper at a distance to model to the audience
how "a very, very short string will look like a point particle" from afar.
He explained that "each vibration of the string results in a point particle,
[so] one string gives rise to infinitely many fermion (matter) and boson
(force) particles.” In string theory, the <a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/science/what-are-gravitons-and-do-they-really-exist" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">graviton</a>,
a hypothetical elementary particle that mediates "the force of gravity
between matter" is "realised by the lowest energy vibration of a closed
string," potentially providing a quantum theory for gravity.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Assoc. Prof. Tan described how string theory supports the
concept of a multiverse, with different physical laws in each universe.
String theory postulates that “our universe is actually <a href="https://www.space.com/more-universe-dimensions-for-string-theory.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">10-dimensional</a>”
with the "extra dimensions curled up" in a complex, minute shape called
a <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-mathematician-who-shaped-string-theory-20231016/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Calabi-Yau manifold</a>.
The shapes of extra dimensions influence the properties of particles and
forces in our universe.</p>

</p>
<p>In the absence of experimental results, novel mathematics like the equations
behind the Calabi-Yau manifold serves as the primary tool for verifying
string theory. Assoc. Prof. Tan explained “[strings are] therefore very
difficult to detect [experimentally], as you need huge amounts of energy
to smash the quarks into their smaller, constituent strings.” To illustrate
the minute scale of these strings, he pointed out that “the size of a superstring
is as much smaller than the atom as the atom is smaller than the size of
the solar system!”</p>

</p>
<p>While Assoc. Prof. Tan explored the theoretical foundations of string
theory from a scientist's point of a view, Dr. Joyce Koh Beetuan's talk
“In Search of the Music of String Theory” walked attendees through her
creative process translating scientific theories into sound as a musician.
She discussed her early inspirations from science writing, such as <em>The Elegant Universe </em>by
Brian Greene and a <a href="https://www.ias.edu/sites/default/files/sns/string(3).pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>2002 article</u></a> in <em>Astronomy </em>by
Edward Witten, which prompted her to wonder whether she could bring the
strings of string theory to life through the strings of musical instruments
like violins.</p>

</div>
<p><em>Dr. Joyce Koh presenting her talk, "In Search of the Music of String Theory".</em>
</p>
<p>Dr. Koh drew analogies between how vibrations in string theory produce
different elementary particles like electrons, photons, and neutrinos,
and how vibrations in musical instruments produce harmonics.&nbsp;To demonstrate
this, Dr. Koh asked one of the attendees carrying her violin to play a
few notes.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Dr. Joyce Koh and an attendee demonstrating harmonics through an impromptu violin performance." src="/images/C1049_MP4_07_43_48_08_Still001.jpg">
</div>
<p><em>Dr. Joyce Koh and an attendee demonstrating harmonics through an impromptu violin performance.</em>
</p>
<p>Using this analogy as the basis for her 2010 multimedia production, <em>On the String</em>,
Dr. Koh set out to imagine what “the music of the universe” might sound
like if “we could hear the sounds of these tiny strings of energy.” Participants
were treated to a short video snippet from <em>On the String</em>, “a live
music performance by 16 musicians, including the pipa and harpsichord,
and two new interactive sound sculptures.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr. Koh shared behind-the-scenes content from the production, from brainstorming
notes relating the levels of magnification in the modern atom model to
the various movements of the multimedia work, to early concept sketches
of the large sound sculptures, and experimentations with synthesising sounds
using computer simulations of theoretical strings made of various materials
from titanium, steel, plastic, and glass.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the presentations concluded, the evening's conversations were far from
over. Attendees networked and mingled after the talks, connecting with
other science enthusiasts. The Science Café provided participants an opportunity
to ponder the origins of the universe and music’s role in transmitting
the movements of the firmaments.</p>
<p>Although string theory remains an incomplete framework for unifying physics
awaiting further technological advancements and verification, it remains
a compelling <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/why-is-m-theory-the-leading-candidate-for-theory-of-everything-20171218/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Theory of Everything</a> pushing
us to reimagine how we make sense of the cosmos.&nbsp;</p>
