<p>Mr. Jarrod Chua started <a href="https://www.instagram.com/spaceytales/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Spaceytales</u></a>, an
Instagram page posting space cartoons, during the coronavirus pandemic.
His smiling, charming celestial object characters made hard-to-grasp scientific
concepts relatable and soon went viral, racking up an impressive 30,000
followers across platforms and over 3 million views to date.</p>
<p>Mr. Chua's comics have explained everything from what a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CPqENBoh8gp/?igsh=MXVpMTQwZm04eXRnMw==" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>light year</u></a> is
to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CTMw9VMFGOS/?img_index=4&amp;igsh=dnhvcXFpYTBtNmRj" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>the difference between asteroids, meteors, meteoroids, and comets</u></a>,
along with spotlighting fascinating objects in the cosmos like the giant
pink exoplanet <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CYq19cvNU12/?igsh=MXU1M2Q0bmVrdnA4ZQ%3D%3D" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>GJ 504b</u></a> and
issues such as <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CWS7R6jB2nx/?img_index=1&amp;igsh=M3FucjJtcDFkcG15orbital" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">orbital debris</a>.</p>
<p>His first big break came from none other than NASA. The American space
agency commissioned the then-undergraduate at Singapore Institute of Technology
to <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/parenting-education/singapore-undergrad-over-the-moon-after-us-space-agency-nasa-buys-his-drawings-for-publicity-campaign" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">create a postcard about the James Webb Space Telescope</a> for
public outreach in 2020.</p>
<p>Since 2020, Spaceytales has evolved from a popular Instagram account into
a space edutainment brand featuring Mr. Chua’s talking planets and spacecraft
in comics, merchandise, and physical exhibitions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Chua has worked with organisations such as Science Centre Singapore
to The Office for Space Technology &amp; Industry, ArtScience Museum, ST
Engineering, Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum, Singapore Institute
of Technology, and more to bring STEM topics to life with his distinctively
adorable, quirky art style.</p>
<p>The <em>Void Deck</em> editorial team had the opportunity back in May 2025
to chat with Mr. Chua–who also happens to be a former Science Centre Singapore
intern–on Spaceytales’ origin story, the lessons he’s learned about exhibition
design, and what planet he identifies the most with. Read more to discover
about his unusual and inspiring pathway to a STEM career!</p>
<p><em>The following interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.</em>
</p>
<p><strong>VD: How did you become interested in space?</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>JARROD CHUA: </strong>Since young I've always gravitated somehow
towards the space books at the library. My mom would always bring me to
the library on the weekends and I guess for some magical reason I just
like to gravitate towards the space section and from there I picked up
this interest in space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Going to my teen years, I guess from a philosophical point of view, I
just really like the awe-inspiring nature of space, how it's the final
frontier for humanity. I think, as an optimist, humanity would eventually
become a spacefaring civilisation. And so I am very eager to always learn
more about what's out there and how I can help humanity as a whole move
towards this goal of becoming a spacefaring civilisation so that we don't
go extinct down here on Earth.</p>

</p>
<p><strong>VD: You mentioned your first hook being the space books. What inspired you to start drawing comics and think about illustration as an avenue for you to explore space?</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>JARROD CHUA:</strong> I picked up a graphic design module in Singapore
Polytechnic and that's where I started to hone my skills in graphic design.
During the COVID-19 circuit breaker, I was in national service, and my
unit sent me back home on a stay-home restricted order, [so] I decided
to pass the time by creating Instagram pages [as a] creative outlet. From
there, none of them took off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But one day I just decided to combine my passion for space since childhood
with this skill of graphic design. And why comics? I guess I thought it
was a fun medium that was very visual and less "wordsy" so that I could
sort of release my creativity but at the same time communicate a bit of
science facts.</p>
<p><strong>VD: Your content's very playful and humorous, your comics for Science Centre Singapore's previous blog<em> I Saw the Science</em> managed to explain big technical concepts like the Hadron Collider or planetary defence in a fun and funny way. How do you inject the humour and write the science jokes, but also stay true to the science facts?</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>JARROD CHUA: </strong>Oh, that's a good question, because sometimes
my comics do get fact-checked by people. I do have a considerable following
who are PhD students, scientists, researchers, and they are not afraid
to sound out every time I make a mistake, but that's good.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, there was one comic I did called<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CReCv7VNWaQ/?igsh=YWRqejNkZzl2OW5r" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u> Rare Earth Theory</u></a>,
it was about whether life on Earth is considered rare and all that. But
a scientist from NASA actually DM'ed me and said it should be called "Rare
Earth hypothesis" not theory, and he stated his reasons. And from there
I actually highlighted that in an Instagram story to document this quite,
I guess, funny experience, and you know, this community decided to all
DM me around the same [time].&nbsp;</p>
<p>[So] I thought, why don't I create this community of factcheckers that
sort of give a "stamp of approval" before I hit that post button? They
were very kind to do this because they were volunteering on their own time.</p>
<p>I guess that's one of the challenges that I face because I do need to
balance having it [be] entertaining but at the same time factually correct.
And this is just one of the many safeguards I have in place. Another one
is that I usually will cross-reference several websites, the reputable
ones like NASA, ISA, all the space organisations before coming to a conclusion
with the facts.</p>
<p>This brings me back to a quote that Neil deGrasse Tyson once said, it
goes something like, first, know all your facts and then you can twist
it to your leisure. Him being one of my idols, I try to tailor that in
my approach as well.</p>

</p>
<p><strong>VD: Speaking of Neil deGrasse Tyson, do you have any STEM content creators or science communicators that you admire?&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>JARROD CHUA: </strong>Neil deGrasse Tyson was actually one of
the main reasons I started Spaceytales because I really like how he simplified
complex science topics into a format that was really digestible and entertaining
at the same time for the general audience. I really admired his way of
doing it and he was one of the main reasons why I decided to simplify space
concepts into a way that was appealing and entertaining to the general
audience as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another guy that I really like is Bill Nye the Science Guy. That whole
science community is really awesome, and I take inspiration from them.</p>
<p>In terms of Singapore, I really admire our local community as well, [for
example] @TheWeirdandWild by Qiyun Woo. [We're] doing different topics,
but it's sort of the same gist where she's trying to simplify concepts
from environmental issues. MJ Bio Girl I would think is someone as well
that is really just simplifying the environmental facts and making it entertaining
as well. So that's the international idols and the local idols, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>VD: The people you mentioned have had interesting journeys with STEM content creation. How have you grown as a STEM content creator over the years?</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>JARROD CHUA: </strong>From the start, from an artistic standpoint,
I think my art was quite bad back then during my first few comic posts,
so I really improved on that, [learned] how to capitalise on some comic
rules, like how to express emotions more with comic lines and how to make
use of Instagram's algorithm more to spread it to a wider audience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From an artistic and social media point of view, I think I've adapted
and picked up things that would help improve the quality of STEM output.
From a STEM point of view, I guess from the heart of Spaceytales it has
always been the same, [if] I find something cool and fascinating, and I'll
take that and I'll try to simplify it an make a story out of it with some
characters.</p>
<p><strong>VD: Along the way, you also did an internship at the Science Centre with the Transmedia team. How was your internship experience?</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>JARROD CHUA:</strong> I really enjoyed my internship with the Science
Centre. It was my first time working in a science centre, a scientific
institution. And I really like how I got to [see] first-hand the interactions
between educators and the marketers and other departments, because I guess
in a way what I'm doing is on a very personal, micro level. But in like
a government scale macro level, this would how this would be how it [played]
out. And it's really fascinating and nice to see how all the different
departments work together to produce and give Science Centre its USP in
that sense.</p>

</p>
<p>I really like how I got to meet some pretty cool characters. I remember
one time I met Minister Chan Chun Sing at one of the filmings. And how
I got to go down to this animal farm, it was quite cool to see the animals
and see how they produce the milk and all that. I got to experience first
hand how to simplify the facts given by Science Centre educators to become
the transmedia outputs that we have.</p>

</p>
<p><strong>VD: The past few years you've brought Spaceytales from digital art into physical interactive experiences. What are the biggest lessons you've learned about exhibition design from your experience working on <em>Dot in Space</em>?</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>JARROD CHUA: </strong>The biggest lesson I've learned was that
there are other elements to take into account when designing exhibitions
as compared to graphic work. One of them–very important–being the experiential
design and spatial design.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because with graphic work, you sort of have the luxury of forgoing the
ergonomics of things, because at the end of the day, you'll know that people
will probably experience it through their phone. The ergonomics of that
[is] very simple. It’s just figuring out the aspect ratio and I [post]
based on that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For <em>Dot in Space</em>, it was a different ball game. Because with exhibition
design I had to factor in the varying heights of the patrons, how much
walking space there would be for people, the flow of traffic, the lighting,
the materials, how reflective the material would be to the lighting for
people to see properly, the modularity of the exhibition design, etc.</p>
<p>So all this came into play and I had the privilege of experiencing this
first hand because the <em>Dot in Space</em> team from Science Centre that
I worked with was really nice in terms of giving me a lot of creative leeway
to create this and experiment as we go along. So that really allowed me
to experience first hand the troubles and the benefits of creating exhibition
designs.</p>

</p>
<p><strong>VD: One last question: I saw your ‘What Planet Are You?’ personality quiz on Spaceytales' website. I have to ask: what planet are you?</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>JARROD CHUA: </strong>I think I'm Neptune. I [heavily] referenced
Neptune to the INFJ MBTI personality type. From an astrology standpoint,
it's also one of the more spiritual and dreamy personalities.</p>
<p>I was trying to personify the physical traits of the planet to make this
personality quiz work. At the end, [for example] Mars has very rugged terrain
and the deepest trenches and the highest mountains, so I personified Mars
[as a] rugged sort of daring and bold adventurer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For Uranus, it’s the only planet that rotates on its side, [so] I tried
to personify it as very quirky, sort of beating to his own drum kind of
planet. <em>[Editor’s note: Try the quiz yourself and find what planet you are <a href="https://spaceytales.com/pages/what-planet-are-you" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>.]</em>
