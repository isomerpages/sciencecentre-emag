<p>Did you know early Arab sailors navigated the seas using just a piece
of wood with string in the middle (a tool called a <a href="https://exploration.marinersmuseum.org/object/kamal/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>kamal</u></a>)
and their knowledge of trigonometry and stellar positions? Or that <a href="https://fumiyoshidaermei.wixsite.com/starsofasia/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>many Asian cultures have age-old constellation legends</u></a> just
as fascinating as Greek astrology?</p>
<p>Science Centre Singapore's latest <a href="https://www.science.edu.sg/whats-on/workshops-activities/science-cafe" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Science Café</a> session,
"Beyond the Stars: Science, Culture and the Cosmos", introduced attendees
to the wonders of the study of the night sky, from the history of the development
of astronomical instruments to the cultural significance of the stars.</p>
<p>Held on Saturday 12 April 2025 from 2:00pm-4:00pm at Singapore Science
Park as part of this year's <a href="https://www.science.edu.sg/whats-on/dot-in-space-2025" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Dot in Space</a> festival,
the event featured two distinguished speakers: Dr Abel Yang, Senior Lecturer
at the National University of Singapore's Department of Physics, and Mr
Meng Hwee Lim, Senior Science Educator at Science Centre Singapore.</p>
<p>Science Café is a ticketed monthly informal talk series organised by Science
Centre Singapore for adults 18 years old and above to discuss various hot
science topics over dinner and drinks. This alcohol-free, kid-friendly
special edition of Science Café brought the programme's fun, casual science
chats to families and the general public excited to blast off into outer
space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hosted at the main stage, the public session was one of several space
science-related activities at Dot in Space 2025, from an exhibition showcasing
stunning satellite imagery of Earth and a build-your-own-satellite station,
to a live planetarium show and interactive star constellations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Science Café session kicked off with an icebreaker for audience members
to design and name their very own constellation using big sheets of papers
with a star map print-out. Participants proposed various entertaining constellations,
from dinosaurs to lamps and Pokémon-inspired creations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dr. Yang's talk focused on the science of astrometry and stellar positioning.
Using the main stage's screen to project a planetarium software showing
the night sky, he brought the audience along on a virtual tour to explain
how stars have held practical meaning for navigation, agriculture, and
calendar systems for different cultures throughout history.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, while the Orion constellation is known as a <a href="https://earthsky.org/constellations/orion-the-hunter-most-recognizable/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>hunter</u></a> in
Greek mythology, Dr. Yang explained that in Java, the Orion constellation
is represented as a plough because the constellation’s appearance in December
signals the beginning of the planting season.&nbsp; "At the end of the
planting season," due to the passage of time and the Earth's motion, the
celestial plough "will be on the other side of the sky ... [and] be upside
down" like a real-life plough with its tools laid out to dry after a hard
day of farming.</p>

</p>
<p>Dr. Yang also explained how early navigators would use Polaris (also known
as the North Star) to plot maps based on latitude prior to the advent of
magnetic compasses and satellites.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a quick gauge of how high Polaris was above the horizon, people stretched
out their arms and stuck out their finger to estimate the degree of elevation
since the space between "the bottom of your finger to the top of your finger
... measures about one and a half degree[s]," Dr. Yang said.</p>
<p>By keeping Polaris "at the same level, same position every night," early
Arab sailors could "sail from Arabia to India, and later on from India
to Southeast Asia."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rather than guess the elevation using their hands, Arab sailors invented
an elegantly simple navigational tool called the kamal: a flat, rectangular
wooden board with a knotted string attached in the centre. The string was
knotted so that “one knot [measured] basically one finger's angle, one
and a half degrees.” By stretching the string from one’s chin and aligning
the top of the kamal with Polaris and the bottom edge with the horizon,
sailors could sail accurately to where they wanted to go.</p>

</p>
<p>To complement Dr. Yang's scientific overview of how the stars were used
as guideposts for navigation, agriculture, and calendars, the next talk
by Mr. Meng Hwee Lim explored cultural myths around constellations in Asia.
Although the International Astronomy Union officially recognizes 88 constellations
mostly rooted in Greco-Roman mythology, Mr. Meng Hwee Lim's presentation
delved into star stories from Asian perspectives.&nbsp;</p>

</p>
<p>For example, in Thailand, the Orion constellation is seen as a turtle,
instead of the huntsman of Greek mythology or plough in Javanese culture.
After the talk, Mr. Lim shared another example of a constellation imagined
in two different ways: <a href="https://www.space.com/16947-scorpius-constellation.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Scorpius</u></a>,
represented as a scorpion in Greco-Roman tradition, that is regarded as
a <a href="https://archive.hokulea.com/ike/hookele/hawaiian_star_lines.html#manaiakalani" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>demi-god’s fish hook</u></a> in
Polynesian culture.</p>
<p>Mr. Lim went on to share some examples of enduring Asian star stories,
referencing an open-source book <em><a href="https://fumiyoshidaermei.wixsite.com/starsofasia/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Stars of Asia: Myths and Legends of Stars and the Universe, loved by Asian people</u></a></em> published
by a group of researchers across Asia.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the memorable myths the Senior Science Educator shared include
the famous story of the Weaver Girl and Cowherd, found in countries such
as Japan, China, Korea, and Vietnam.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to ancient Chinese lore, two lovers, an immortal woman and a
mortal man symbolizing the stars Vega and Altair are separated by a heavenly
river—the Milky Way—and are only permitted to reunite on the seventh day
of the seventh lunar month, when a flock of magpies create a bridge for
the lovers to meet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the Pleiades star cluster is often represented as a story of <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-worlds-oldest-story-astronomers-say-global-myths-about-seven-sisters-stars-may-reach-back-100-000-years-151568" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>seven sisters</u></a> in
the West, a captivating tale from Thailand instead characterizes the Pleiades
constellation as a mother hen and her six chicks. The noble animals choose
to sacrifice themselves as food for a hungry monk, transforming the Western
themes of grief and sisterhood into a Buddhist reincarnation moralizing
tale.</p>
<p>From celestial navigation tools to Asian folklore, this Science Café gave
attendees a taste of astronomy. If you're curious to expand your knowledge
