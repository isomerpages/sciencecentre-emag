<p>New Year's Eve: a time for glitz and glamour, from spectacular fireworks
to shiny confetti, fizzy champagne, and glittery outfits. Not to mention:
splendid light shows and dancing late into the night! You may have seen
disco balls suspended above revellers at New Year's Eve parties, but have
you considered the disco ball as a technological device?</p>
<p>In this feature, we unpack the science behind this party favourite and
explore the physics of the disco ball, the origins of this holiday decor,
and how festive fun can even help us illuminate the future of space science.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I'm a mirrorball / I'll show you every version of yourself tonight /
I'll get you out on the floor / Shimmering beautiful" - Taylor Swift, "Mirrorball"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How does the disco ball create the "shimmering beautiful" displays referenced
in Taylor Swift's song? Disco balls are <a href="https://doi.org/10.1119/1.4967890" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">spherical objects</a> covered with
hundreds or thousands of <a href="https://www.sciencing.com/plane-mirror-5103685/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">plane mirrors</a>.
When light shines on the disco ball, the small mirrors reflect the beam
at different angles simultaneously, scattering spots of light throughout
the room. As the disco ball rotates, the light spots move, creating brilliant
displays.</p>
<p>Fittingly, the dazzling novel lighting effect was first engineered by
electricians for a social event. The <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/653099/disco-ball-facts-history" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">earliest mention of a disco ball</a> appears
in an 1897 issue of <em>The Electrical Worker</em>, a trade publication
in Charlestown, Massachusetts, within a description of a ballroom that
featured a "mirrored ball" above a dance floor. However, this was a unique
creation, not intended for mass production.</p>
<p>The first commercial disco ball was patented as a <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/64276/myriad-reflector-early-forgotten-disco-ball" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">"myriad reflector"</a> by
Louis Bernard Woeste in 1917. A globe 27 inches wide plastered with over
1200 tiny mirrors, the device was advertised for its novel lighting effects,
with <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/64276/myriad-reflector-early-forgotten-disco-ball" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">one magazine ad</a> cheekily
comparing the myriad reflector's illuminations to the sparkling magnificence
of the Milky Way.</p>
<p>In the 1920s, this proto-disco ball was sold to entertainment venues like
<a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/653099/disco-ball-facts-history" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">dance halls, jazz clubs, and circuses</a>to throw brilliant, radiant light
around the room in an era where special artificial lighting was not common.</p>

<p>The disco ball famously reached its peak popularity in the 1970s with
disco fever and bands like the Bee Gees taking off across the USA and even
in Singapore, where <a href="https://biblioasia.nlb.gov.sg/vol-15/issue-1/apr-jun-2019/disco-fever/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">local discotheques</a> installed
their own disco balls.</p>
<p>More recently, the disco ball experienced what<em> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/26/style/disco-ball-comeback.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">The New York Times</a> </em>described
as a "comeback" during the COVID-19 pandemic, with searches of the item
surging on various online shopping platforms as consumers sought nostalgic
joy during times of crisis. Apple even added the disco ball emoji in 2021
after years of being the top-requested emoji according to <a href="https://blog.emojipedia.org/top-emoji-requests-2018/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Emojipedia</a>.</p>
<p>The resurgence of disco ball created new consumer demand. How are these
ever-popular sparkly novelties manufactured? The video below documents
how disco balls are made in a factory in Japan, showing how sheet metal
is bent into half spheres, which are then screwed together, covered with
tiny mirror tiles, applied with cement to fill mirror gaps, and finally
tested for adequate light reflection.</p>

<p>Disco balls aren't just pretty ornaments or kitschy decor from the past.
In fact, applying the principles of disco balls to the space industry may
one day mean we can welcome the new year in style on another planet in
the future.</p>
<p>In 1976, NASA launched the Laser Geodynamics Satellite (LAGEOS), a 408-kg
satellite with "no sensors, electronics, [nor] moving parts" (<a href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/lageos" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">NASA Science</a>).
This unique "brass core surrounded by an aluminum shell that's covered
in 426 retroreflectors" closely resembled a "giant disco ball" (<a href="https://www.space.com/32981-nasa-disco-ball-satellite-still-in-space.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Space.com</a>).
By shining laser beams at LAGEOS and tracking the time the time it takes
for the laser beam to travel back to Earth, scientists can glean a wealth
of information about the Earth's geophysics.</p>

</p>
<p>LAGEOS is still orbiting Earth today as a permanent reference point for
"high-precision laser ranging", helping scientists "measure the movement
of Earthâ€™s tectonic plates, detect irregularities in the rotation of the
planet, weigh it, and track small shifts in its center of mass" (<a href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/lageos" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">NASA Science</a>).</p>
<p>LAGEOS-2, an idential sister satellite builted by the Italian Space Agency,
was launched in 1992. The satellite has continued to transmit invaluable
data back to scientists on Earth, including more precise data confirming
one of the predictions of Einsten's theory of relativity that Earth's rotation
drags the fabric of space-time (<a href="https://www.space.com/456-einstein-warped-view-space-confirmed.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Space.com</a>).
It's remarkable to think that all of this data can come from throwing two
giant disco balls in space!</p>
<p>Disco balls could also aid astronomy here on Earth. This year, a group
of astronomers from various institutions published <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6552/ad1fa0" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">a paper in </a><em><a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6552/ad1fa0" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Physics Education</a></em> titled
"<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14173" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Why every observatory needs a disco ball"</a>.
They proposed that disco balls could be operated by observatories as cheap
and readily available pinhole cameras that could "project bright light
sources (such as the Sun) on a wall or screen" for large groups.</p>
<p>The researchers experimented with implementing disco balls when observing
various astronomical phenomena such as solar eclipses and concluded that
"commercial disco balls provide a safe, effective and instructive way of
observing the Sun", not to mention, and "easy and fun" way to engage the
public with science (<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6552/ad1fa0" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Cumming et al., 2024</a>).</p>
<p>In a feature for <em><a href="https://physicsworld.com/a/light-fever-bringing-disco-to-astronomy/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Physics World</a> </em>written
by Laura Hiscott, researcher Robert Cumming explains that he got the idea
for the paper after hanging up a disco ball for a New Year's Eve party,
watching the light reflect off the disco ball, and realising that <a href="https://physicsworld.com/a/light-fever-bringing-disco-to-astronomy/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">"each bright patch on the walls was an image of the Sun."</a>
</p>
<p>As we say goodbye to 2024, the shimmering disco ball showcases the interplay
between science, art, and celebration. From illuminating dance floors to
aiding space exploration and astronomical observations, these glittering
spheres remind us that innovation often comes from unexpected places. Here's
to a future as bright and full of discovery as the countless reflections
from our beloved disco balls!</p>
