<h4>Did you know that in 2029, Lunar New Year and Hari Raya Puasa are projected to fall on the same day? What causes these festive dates to shift each year, and why are our calendars not stable markers of time? Senior Science Educator Meng Hwee Lim explains.</h4>
<p>Calendars are strange things. Although a calendar may seem like a reliable
way to measure the passage of time, what we call a day, week, or month
do not match the movements of the Earth, Sun, Moon, or stars with total
accuracy. As a result, we need to invent new methods of dividing and codifying
time: every few years, one needs to add in an extra day (what we call leap
years) or even a whole extra month. But having a universal standard of
tracking time is a system that we cannot do without, and so we need to
submit to the will of the almighty, albeit imperfect, calendar.</p>
<p>What is the primary function of a calendar? Calendars indicate the passing
of the seasons and when we are supposed to do certain things, like when
to sow the seeds and when to harvest the crops, when to celebrate someone's
birth or passing as a special occasion. We know spring starts on roughly
on the 21st of March on the spring equinox where the days start to become
longer in the Northern Hemisphere —that is when planting should start.
We also know when to celebrate key religious festivals, for example, Christmas,
which is observed on 25<sup>th</sup> December. These are just some of the
important tasks we assign to the calendar. But how did we form a calendar
that tells us the above?</p>
<h4><strong>Gregorian Calendar</strong></h4>
<p>The described calendar uses the rising the setting of the sun to mark
and form the calendar, counting the number of days before or after certain
events to set out the dates. We call this a solar calendar, but it is more
widely known as the Gregorian calendar. Invented in 1582, it is mainly
used in the Western world, and remarkably, this centuries-old method still
dictates how we set our days and dates internationally.</p>
<p>But there are many other cultures around the world that have formed their
own calendars. Consider, for example, the Chinese lunar calendar and the
Islamic calendar.</p>
<h4><strong>Chinese Calendar</strong></h4>
<p>Let's start with the Chinese lunar calendar. Counter to its name, it is
not just a lunar calendar but what we call a lunisolar calendar. In other
words, it takes into account the daily rising and setting of the Sun as
well as the changing phases of the Moon. It is most likely done this way
because the calendar is used as an agricultural calendar and most likely
a religious or cultural one as well.</p>
<p>The first day of the month always starts with the new moon phases of the
moon, and a month ends when the next new moon starts. This goes on for
12 months. On average, there are 12 full moons in a year so this lines
up perfectly! Those of you who know your moon facts or the calendar itself
will notice a problem right away.</p>
<p>The phases of the moon last for about 28-29 days, so one will end up with
some missing days at the end of the year, 11 days in fact! The Chinese
came up with a great solution: just keep following the moon phases, and
in about three to four years, you will end up with enough missing days
to add a whole entire month into the year. That year will have 13 months,
just like this year (2025), where there will be two 6th lunar months. This
is part of a larger pattern between the Sun and Moon that lasts for 19
years, known as the Metonic cycle. In these 19 years, there will be 12
years with 12 months, and 7 leap years with 13 months.</p>
<p>But why go through all the trouble of tracking the days and months? Because,
like their Western counterparts, the Chinese also use this calendar to
tell them when to start planting and when the new year starts. Adding this
extra month somewhere makes it such that the planting and harvesting seasons
fall roughly around the same time every year, give or take a few weeks.
This way the seasons and the calendar roughly lines up, making it easy
to plan ahead to stockpile food and prepare for upcoming festivals which
usually start on the new moon.</p>
<p>Also, it makes the moon an easy sign to determine what stage of the month
one is in. Just look up at night, or daytime, and one can roughly guess
from the phase and position of the moon how far along one is in that month.
Full moon? You are about halfway through the month.</p>
<h4><strong>Islamic Calendar</strong></h4>
<p>What if you don't add in this extra month and just follow the moon? Well,
you end up with a calendar system like the Islamic calendar, which is a
purely lunar calendar. The month starts when there is a new moon and ends
when the new moon comes again. No need to worry if the lunar month is a
little shorter here and there, no need to worry if the 12 months do not
add up to a year. This is because the purpose of the Islamic calendar is
not agricultural but religious. The calendar is used to determine the dates
of important Islamic holidays and rituals like Ramadan and Eid celebrations.</p>
<p>The Islamic calendar consists of 12 months and runs slightly shorter than
our Gregorian calendar, again by 11 days. Over some 33 odd years, one would
see the Islamic holidays move earlier and earlier in the year and cycle
back on itself. At least in Singapore, we would pay closer attention to
the fasting month, Ramadan, and the two Muslim public holidays, Hari Raya
Puasa and Hari Raya Haji. These religious dates always follow the moon
phases to determine when the days of observance starts and ends, as well
as when in the year it would roughly fall on. If the months move forward
every year, there will be a year where Ramadan starts in January, and 11
full moons later somewhen in December, it would be time for another Ramadan.
But 2 Ramadan would also mean 2 Hari Raya right?</p>
<p>As far as I understand, there is an element of fairness in this. It is
not felt as much in Singapore because we are located near the equator where
the days are of roughly equal length, but if one is practicing Ramadan
in other countries located further north or south of the equator, the days
can be much longer or shorter, and one starts the fast before the sun rises
and breaks fast after the sun sets. Therefore, those who observe Ramadan
during the summer will have to endure a longer fasting period as compared
to those having to fast during winter. A lunar calendar will slowly move
the fasting period across the year so everyone will have about equal fasting
periods over the years. I am not the expert in this, but there is a sort
of beauty in this arrangement that takes into consideration all Muslims
around the world.</p>
<h4><strong>Gongxi Raya?</strong></h4>
<p>The interesting thing about using the new moon to mark each month for
both the lunar and lunisolar calendar is that the Islamic and Chinese calendar
months start and end on the same day. With the ever-shifting lunar calendar
together with the roughly static lunisolar calendar, there are bound to
be days where Chinese and Islamic festive occasions converge.</p>
<p>For example, Lunar New Year and Hari Raya Puasa are projected to fall
on the same day in 2029, 2030, and 2031. The two celebrations will not
overlap in 2028 and 2032 as these years are leap years where an extra month
is added to the Chinese calendar, thus moving the Chinese and Islamic calendars
out of sync with each other. And the increasingly “early” arrival of Islamic
holidays is honestly not as rare as it sounds, as every 33 years, the shifting
of the festive dates is just a product of following the Moon as it orbits
the Earth.</p>
<p>Of course, it is funny how we have adopted this makeshift system to count
time. Following the phases of the moon to count months has absolutely no
connection to movement of the Earth around the Sun to count years. Throw
in the rising the setting of the sun, Earth's rotation, to count days,
and we could not come up with a more disconnected way to track time, other
than the fact that it is has historically served as the most consistent
way to mark the passage of time for our ancestors. Not to mention that
the Moon's orbit is getting larger, meaning that the lunar months are very
slowly getting longer! So maybe one day in the far future, we will have
a proper 12 lunar month year.</p>
<p>For now, I look forward to 2029, where everyone in Singapore will be incredibly
busy doing house visits during the Lunar New Year and Hari Raya Puasa double
festivities!</p>
