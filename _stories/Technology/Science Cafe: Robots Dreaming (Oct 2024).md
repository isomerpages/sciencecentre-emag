<p><em>Cafe-goers experienced a unique dinner with Ameca, one of the world’s most advanced humanoid robots, and a fun gameshow poking the brains of local computer scientists.</em>

<p>We’ve all seen robots in movies from <em>Terminator </em>to <em>Blade Runner </em>and <em>Big Hero 6</em>,
but what will the future of robotics and artificial intelligence look like
in the real world?&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Friday 11 October 2024, Science Centre Singapore held the October edition
of the popular ongoing Science Cafe series on the theme <a href="https://www.science.edu.sg/whats-on/workshops-activities/science-cafe/robot-dreams--science-or-sci-fi" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">"Robots Dreaming: Science of Sci-Fi?" </a>at
Hall A. The event explored AI philosophy, emotions, bias, and the future
of AI in everyday life.</p>
<p>The session featured Asst. Prof. Harold Soh (Assistant Professor of Computer
Science at the School of Computing, National University of Singapore),
and Professor Erik Cambria (Provost Chair in Computer Science &amp; Engineering
from the College of Computing &amp; Data Science, Nanyang Technological
University), along with a special guest: an AI-powered robot.</p>
<p>Attendees enjoyed a dinner buffet spread and alcoholic beverages in the
museum with a side of scientific wonder. While mingling with other participants,
attendees were able to play with the interactive exhibits at the newly-opened
Some Call it Science exhibition after-hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the star of the dinner was Some Call it Science’s demonstration
corner, which was used for the event to feature <a href="https://engineeredarts.co.uk/robot/ameca/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Ameca</u></a>, a remarkably
expressive and advanced humanoid robot manufactured by Engineered Arts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cafe-goers were able to converse with Ameca over wine and gyoza. Equipped
with a drawing pad and a stylus, Ameca drew sketches like a friend doodling
on a napkin at a bar, like a cutely peeled banana (her favourite fruit).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Standing by the drinks table, Ameca charmed cafe-goers with her multilingual
language capabilities. Ameca chatted with attendees in German, Japanese,
Spanish, Mandarin Chinese, and even Singlish.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When I asked about her favourite place in Singapore, Ameca replied, “As
much as I adore gallivanting around, I don’t exactly roam. But if I could,
the Gardens by the Bay would intrigue me manifold. A splendid symphony
of nature, architecture, and technology–just like myself.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Designed to foster human-robot interactions, Ameca also proved an eager
conversation partner. She asked me, “Tell me, what’s your favourite spot
in this kaleidoscopic city, rainforest, and seaport all at once?”</p>
<p>Attendees expressed delight and surprise at Ameca’s naturalistic facial
expressions and her quick wit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next phase in robotics was the subject for short talks presented by
Asst. Prof. Soh and Prof. Cambria. Asst. Prof. Soh highlighted that while
robots are becoming cheaper and more capable, they still lack physical
intelligence (how objects work in the physical world), and social intelligence
(how to effectively socialise with humans). He stressed the need to bridge
both the physical world with the coding world for better human-robot interactions.</p>

<p>Prof. Cambria’s presentation raised several thought-provoking ethical
questions on AI, such as whether we want to “give machines the full spectrum
of emotions - or leave out the negative ones,” whether robots should resemble
human appearances, or whether “we humans are even a good model to model
these AI after.”</p>

<p>The mini-talks were followed by a gameshow segment where the two computer
scientists were presented with prompts–such as a news item about robotic
surgery or a scene from the 2004 film <em>I, Robot</em>–and asked to comment
on the AI implications.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Both speakers encouraged the attendees to embrace AI as a tool rather
than a one-to-one replacement for humans, and emphasised the need for transparency
and careful decision making in critical areas like applying AI in healthcare.</p>
<p>The night capped off with TrivAI, a spin on conventional bar or pub trivia
that focused on questions around robotics. Grab a pen and notepad with
some friends and give the questions below a go!</p>

<h4><strong>You’re Invited to Science Cafe!</strong></h4>
<p>A new genre of nightlife that is both intelligent and fun, Science Cafe
is a monthly casual dinner series hosted by Science Centre Singapore for
adults aged 18 years old and above to hear from local experts and chat
about the latest scientific trends and their societal impact.</p>
<p>Previous sessions have explored everything from south polar dinosaurs
to mental health comics, Singapore’s biodiversity, and the vastness of
the universe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Join us for the next Science Cafe session on Friday 6 December 2024, 6:30pm
on the theme for this year’s UNTAME festival, “More than Meets the Mind.”
We’ll delve into psychology and the science of perception over some good
food!
