<p>Who says fashion can't slay whilst saving the Earth? Attendees were wowed
by stunning fashion designs using sustainable materials and digital fabrication
technologies at the <a href="https://www.science.edu.sg/stem-inc/industrial-partnership-programme/dfs-x-artist" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">DFS X Artist</a> Grand
Finale held on Saturday 1 November 2025 at Science Centre Singapore's Marquee
event space.</p>
<p>Over 100 young artists from eight schools participated in the programme,
alongside seniors from two active ageing centres: Yuhua Sewmates and the
Adventist Active Centre @ Kallang Trivista. Started in 2022, the DFS X
Artist Programme is a groundbreaking STEAM initiative bringing professional
artists, community partners, and students together to explore the intersections
of art, design, and digital fabrication.</p>
<p>Initiated by Science Centre Singapore's <a href="https://www.science.edu.sg/stem-inc/digital-fabrication-space" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Digital Fabrication Space</a> (DFS),
participants learn foundational skills such as 3D printing, laser cutting,
vinyl cutting, and electronics to create their very own artworks, including
fashion pieces. In 2023, DFS X Artist launched their annual runway show
to spotlight the innovation and interdisciplinary creativity of participants'
designs.</p>
<p>This year's programme was sponsored by Applied Materials and supported
by SG Eco Fund. The 2025 theme "Sustainability and Upcycling" tasked participants
with designing eco-conscious clothing utilising secondhand textiles. Fashion
designers and student instructors from Temasek Polytechnic's School of
Design mentored school groups, whilst community organisers from social
enterprise Commenhers guided participants from ageing centres.</p>
<p>In her opening speech for the DFS X Artist Grand Finale, Ms Tham Mun See,
Chief Executive of Science Centre Board, called this year's theme "very
timely and pertinent," explaining that "when we use synthetic fabric to
make garments, and then we dispose of it very quickly, we actually contribute
to environmental waste."&nbsp;</p>
<p>She stressed, "These garments don't just [go] away. They actually fragment
into microplastics, which then seep into the soil and water and air, killing
some animals and plants."</p>
<p>The participants' designs "transform used textiles into upcycled fashion
pieces that don't just look stunning but also tell meaningful stories about
the planet we share," Ms Tham wrote in a foreword for the <a href="https://for.edu.sg/dfsxartistbooklet" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">DFS X Artist 2025 programme booklet</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Their work is a reminder that art doesn't just reflect the world, it
can help reshape it for a more sustainable tomorrow."</p>
<h4><strong>Eco-Design Takes Centre Stage</strong></h4>
<p>The thirty-one bespoke runway outfits showcased kaleidoscopic views of
nature, with fashion pieces presenting style statements about the state
of the Earth. The designs referenced everything from forest biodiversity
to marine life, industrial eras to ocean pollution, and Asian animal spirits
to futuristic technologies.</p>
<p>Among the standout looks was an iceberg-blue iridescent ball gown inspired
by the moon jelly <a href="https://www.marinebio.org/species/moon-jellyfishes/aurelia-aurita/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Aurelia aurita</a>.
In their description for the show booklet, student designers Matriano Ianah
Reisha, Toh Jia Jun, Alena Piong Jia Ying, Stanislas Chur Song Zhi, and
Chong Yu Xuan from Regent Secondary School wrote that the jellyfish is
"ephemeral, luminous, and now imperilled." Trailing translucent "tentacles"
made from plastic bags and bottles, together with a sea sponge bag, complemented
the dress, which they emphasised told a story of "beauty under siege."</p>

<p>Other aquatic-inspired designs featured flowy organza fabrics juxtaposed
with fishing net drapings and accoutrements like 3D-printed marine animal
hair pieces.</p>

</div>
<p>Drawing inspiration from flora, student designers Claire Tan, Ooi Jen
Nin Dilys, Wong Beatrice Clare, and Lim Xin Er Crystal from Nan Chiau High
School created "Petals of Grace", a giant maximalist bejewelled bodice.
Reminiscent of a huge cream-white flower petal, the bodice was embellished
with trinkets repurposing Spring Festival flower decorations, toilet paper
rolls, plastic bottles, twine, and metal drink cans.</p>

<p>Another look, "Inferno" by Alicia Lim Li Si, Xu Yuxuan, and Leow He Myn
Elise from Nanyang Girls' High School, featured an asymmetrical fairy-like
fluttering green and gold leaf dress with a raw unhemmed yellow-orange
underskirt trailing the floor like a forest fire.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

</div>
<p>Other pieces explored ecotopian visions of tomorrow, from "Jagabi", a
futuristic, modular modernist patchwork kimono made of denim and batik
to show "fusion of both culture and technology" (designed by Ng Lin Xuan
Valerie, Pua Yu Tong, and Foo Yew Ning from Nanyang Girls' High School)
to a solarpunk "modern farmer" outfit, "To Grow a Garden", consisting of
cargo pants with aluminium foil panels and LED lights styled with a utility
vest and painted skateboard (designed by Jesse Huang Zi Yu, Lee Yee Ruu,
Chloe Hu, and Yu Zhixuan from Nanyang Girls' High School).</p>

<h4><strong>Digital Craft Meets Sustainable Design</strong></h4>
<p>Beyond the visual spectacle, the DFS X Artist programme offered participants
a unique opportunity to gain hands-on experience bringing sustainable fashion
concepts to life through digital fabrication technologies.</p>
<p>Marcus Low Hong Cheng from Canberra Secondary School modelled and helped
create a Japanese-inspired outfit based on the mythical fox spirit kitsune
with his teammates Aeryn Lim Wei Ting, Koh Rui En Vera, Nur Iffah Farliyssha
Binte Muhammad Farhan, and Denisse Voo Xiao You. Considering himself more
of a "science-leaning" student, he shared that he enjoyed learning art
and design principles through the programme. His first fashion design experience
taught him that "we don't need to use new fabric" as the team upcycled
mesh, secondhand garments, satin, and batiste.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/251101_DFS_X_Artist_2025_0005.jpg">
</div>
<p>"We don't need to use cotton, all that stuff to create new fashionable
clothes. Instead, we could use the resources around us... to help sustain
our life and help to improve the environment," Marcus said. The team painstakingly
designed their look with a careful choice of materials, including electronics
to make their kimono glow. Inserting LED lights for the fox's "tail" of
the garment alone took two to three hours with every team member's focused
assistance.</p>
<p>Other students reaffirmed the sentiment that whilst secondhand textiles
may be used, that doesn't mean they are unusable. Sophie Lum Wan Mei from
Chung Cheng High School (Yishun) shared that she found it "amazing" that
secondhand textiles could be "woven together in [so many] different ways."
She was also surprised to learn that beyond upcycling, some fabrics such
as 100% natural fibre clothing could be composted to enrich soils and reduce
landfill waste.</p>
<p>Sophie and her teammates Cheong Hui Yi, Au Jing Wen, and San Jing Hui
designed a steampunk-inspired look with a bustle skirt and trail from old
denim. She shared that they learned how to add gathers and pleats to the
blouse from the Temasek Polytechnic student instructors.</p>

</div>
<p>Besides learning essential sewing techniques, Sophie and her teammates
received a foundational introduction to 3D modelling. The final outfit
featured several gears as homage to the steam engine and railroad era.
Technicians helped Sophie and her teammates print the pieces at Science
Centre Singapore's Digital Fabrication Space. Sophie candidly shared her
appreciation for the time it takes to master 3D software, explaining "it's
much more technical than I thought it would be."</p>
<p>The programme encouraged participants to be resourceful and inventive.
Arysya Natasya binte Muhammad from Canberra Secondary School explained
that this year's theme and challenge to use upcycled fabrics helped her
"expand her ideas" and creativity. "When you explore more further into
the fashion world, you realise that everything can be used in different
ways."</p>
<h4><strong>Weaving Communities Together</strong></h4>

</div>
<p>The programme's inclusive approach created connections across generations
and abilities. The DFS X Artist programme gathered designers across society,
from students at special education (SPED) schools to senior makers from
YuHua Sewmates and Adventist Active Centre @ Kallang Trivista, to create
a community capsule collection.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/251101_DFS_X_Artist_2025_0170.jpg">
</div>
<p>Students from Canberra Secondary School proudly modelled six ensembles
comprising the seniors' dress pieces, accessorised with vests, tote bags,
and bucket hats embellished by students from AWWA School @ Bedok, AWWA
School @ Napiri, and Towner Gardens School.</p>
<p>The joyful accessories by the SPED students showcased bright Jackson Pollock-like
paint splatters, a sprinkling of colourful buttons, and sew-on patches
in the shapes of stars, hearts, leaves, clouds, and suns. Paired with the
garments by senior makers featuring appliqués, lace embellishments, and
shimmering fabrics rescued from scrap heaps, the runway looks evoked the
vibrant patterns of fish scales or butterfly wings.</p>

<p>Madam Aminah binte Mohamed Kamari, a senior from Yuhua Sewmates who participated
in the DFS X Artist programme in both 2024 and 2025, said, "I love this
programme because it makes us more curious about design, [see] fashion
is alive... and be creative."</p>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

<p>An experienced seamstress, she shared that she finds "mixing technology
with old ideas" fascinating and enhanced her own sewing knowledge by learning
about more modern industrial techniques like Cricut and laser cutting.
She also appreciated how the programme encourages "more youngsters to do
sewing" and to inject new influences like cosplay into fashion design.</p>
<p>Madam Kamari and another maker from Yuhua Sewmates, Fatin, crafted hand-sewn
and machine-sewn lace and patchwork embellishments on a shirt, skirt, and
shorts representing "the universe" through mismatched textures that come
together in harmony. She said the completed outfit also symbolised how
"we can help not to clog the earth with all those fast fashion[s]."</p>
