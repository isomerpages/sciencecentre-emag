<p>Happy Valentine’s Day! To celebrate love this year, we’re exploring the
science of online dating. In this feature, we’ll explore the psychology
and technology behind the dating platforms that are rewiring romance in
the 21st century.</p>
<h4><strong>Modern Romance</strong></h4>
<p></p>

<p>Although online dating sites like eHarmony or OkCupid were somewhat ostracized
in the early ’00s, online dating has become more common.</p>
<p>One of my colleagues met her husband on Coffee Meets Bagel. Another married
couple I know met through a Facebook hobby group.</p>
<p>It’s not just my social circles: more people in Singapore are finding
their significant others online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To learn about this modern phenomenon, ISTS corresponded over email with
Dr. Jean Liu, Adjunct Assistant Professor at Yale-NUS College and Founder
of Insights Bridge Consultancy, who taught a module at Yale-NUS College
on online dating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“In a 2021 survey of 2848 singles, the National Population and Talent
Division found that 1 in 3 respondents who were dating had met online –
up from 1 in 10 a decade before,” Dr. Jean Liu explains.</p>
<p>According to the same <a href="https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/online-dating-singles-singapore-never-dated-survey-2015846" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">survey</a>,
openness towards dating sites or apps jumped from 19 per cent in 2012 to
58 per cent in 2021. With growing awareness and acceptance of such platforms,
online dating has become part of mainstream culture.</p>
<p><a href="https://cnalifestyle.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/commentary-rise-online-dating-during-pandemic-may-see-more-serious-relationships-marriages-next-few-years-278526" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">COVID-19</a> restrictions
only accelerated the popularity of online dating, with dating apps like
Paktor reporting a “<a href="https://cnalifestyle.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/commentary-rise-online-dating-during-pandemic-may-see-more-serious-relationships-marriages-next-few-years-278526" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">10 per cent increase in new users</a>”
during circuit breaker and that “<a href="https://cnalifestyle.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/commentary-rise-online-dating-during-pandemic-may-see-more-serious-relationships-marriages-next-few-years-278526" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Singapore users spent 10 times longer on the app than they did before the pandemic.</a>”</p>
<p>While some people may have resorted to dating apps while it was difficult
to meet face-to-face during the COVID-19 pandemic, online dating seems
to be here for good.</p>
<p>Even our <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2024/02/12/viral-dating-terms-explained-defined-guide/72557283007/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">slang is changing</a> to
reflect relationships mediated through our devices (thanks, Gen Z). Have
you been on the receiving end of “ghosting” – when your crush cuts off
all contact and suddenly stops sending you messages? Or perhaps your friend
“soft-launched” their partner on Instagram with ambiguous teaser trailer
shots of their mysterious new beau, such as matching coffee orders or linked
hands.</p>
<p>“We’ve come a long way: in our grandparents’ generation, it was customary
to be matchmade by trusted individuals,” writes Dr. Liu. “In an age of
smartphones, however, the norms of how we meet partners have changed …
digital technologies have expanded the means by which we search for partners.”</p>

<h4><strong>Behind the Screen</strong></h4>

</div>
<p>What exactly goes on behind the screen of popular dating apps, though,
and how do our phones and computers play matchmaker?&nbsp;</p>
<p>To better understand how dating apps function, ISTS communicated over
email with Alex Tam, Group CEO of Paktor Group.</p>
<p>Paktor Group is a local dating and networking app operator that expanded
from Singapore to become the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/paktor/?originalSubdomain=sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">largest social dating group</a> in
the Southeast Asia and North Asia region. The group has attracted <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/paktor/?originalSubdomain=sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">over 50 million users</a> across
its online and offline dating products, which include <a href="https://gopaktor.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Paktor </a>and
<a href="https://letsgaigai.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">GaiGai</a>.</p>
<p>Paktor Group, which takes its name from the Cantonese word for dating,
began with <a href="https://gopaktor.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Paktor</a>,
a Singapore-founded dating app originally marketed to local users in 2013.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The swiping mechanism for Paktor is generally similar to that with other
dating apps – left swipe is not interested and right swipe means interested.
Singles will only be connected when they mutually swipe right on each other,”
Tam explains.</p>
<p>Users can select certain filters to find their desired partner. Some filters
seem fairly obvious—Tam points to factors such as age and height—but the
Paktor app development team found other variables that are important for
singles in Asia.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, the team “discovered through our users that Horoscope is
useful for users in deciding whether or not to swipe, especially in countries
like Taiwan,” Tam states.
<br>
<br>Designing specifically for Asian users has paid off. “We see more locals
using our dating apps compared to our [Western dating app] competitors
… we also have localised functions, such as the gifting of local stickers
depending on your location i.e. gifting a Taipei 101 or bubble tea sticker
when the user is located in Taiwan,” Tam states.</p>
<p>Paktor uses geolocation data to “[push] suitable profiles closer to the
user based on his/her location” since Tam finds most users “have a preference
for matches who work/stay near them, giving them more opportunities to
meet up.”</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Taking it to the Next Level</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Online_Dating_02.jpg">
</div>
<p></p>
<p>Geolocation data could be key in helping take online dating apps to the
next level. One of the biggest challenges to the legitimacy of such dating
platforms are <a href="https://cnalifestyle.channelnewsasia.com/women/tinder-swindler-netflix-internet-love-scam-warning-signs-singapore-police-302296" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">love scams</a>.
Geolocation data can “flag out scammers at work swiping from another country,”
Tam explains.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We expect to see more efforts in this area to protect real singles such
as more thorough user verification steps,” he adds.</p>
<p>Similarly, Dr. Liu predicts that “addressing scams and other security-related
issues (e.g., privacy, transparency) will continue to be at the forefront
of app development.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a hot topic as Dr. Liu cites, “in 2022, 868 internet love scams
were reported in Singapore – a tenfold increase from one decade ago (where
only 81 cases were reported).”</p>
<p>Along with improved security, Dr. Liu sees the future of online dating
including more “live interaction” features rather than text-based chats.</p>
<p>“App users and researchers have long lamented that swiping and chat functions
aren’t enough to work out whether two people would hit off,” Dr. Liu writes.
“A growing number of dating apps have started offering video functions
… allowing users to work out more quickly whether they’ll be a good match.”</p>
<p>Another fascinating trend includes the integration of artificial intelligence
in online dating. Dr. Liu points to “AI dating assistants who serve as
coaches for the dating experience.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tam writes that online dating “will continue to ride on new technologies
such as Generative AI, Machine Learning, etc to help singles connect better
with potential matches on these platforms,” as the goal is to make the
apps like Paktor “more efficient, reducing the amount of work required
for each user to eventually find the right match.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s what Dr. Liu alludes to as “‘holy grail’ project for online dating”:
a “[refined] prediction model” or effective algorithm that accurately pairs
users with their desired partner.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think Cupid’s arrow, sent by a computer program.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Tips for Singles</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Online_Dating_04.jpg">
</div>
<p>While dating apps certainly provide more opportunities to meet “The One,”
an all-powerful Cupid’s Code is still the stuff of science fiction.</p>
<p>Singles ready to mingle (online) need to brace themselves to search for
their soulmate through trial and error.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Online dating often requires users to swipe many times and converse with
multiple individuals before getting a date,” Dr. Liu states. “In the online
world, you’re likely to give up quickly if you think you’re searching for
just one perfect partner.”</p>
<p>She suggests, “having a growth mindset towards love could be beneficial,
because you’re more likely to persevere in the journey and to give a wider
range of individuals a chance.”</p>
<p>Dr. Liu especially recommends meeting IRL “as soon as you can … that’s
one sure-fire way to know if you’ll hit it off or not.”</p>
<p>“Research has found that a large part of ‘hitting it off’ has to do with
the interpersonal dynamics when two people meet. It’s hard to get a sense
of these dynamics online! If you’re using an online platform and have been
matched, it’s wise to switch quickly to a video call or meet-up in person,”
she elaborates.</p>
<p>But how do you find potential partners to meet up with in the first place?
We asked Tam for some practical tips or “hacks” for singles setting up
their online dating profiles.</p>
<p>“Firstly, users should have at least 3-5 quality photos on their online
profile, each showing a different side to this person, e.g. we see that
men with a photo of them doing sports improve their attractiveness score,”
Tam advises.</p>
<p>“They should also complete their online profile so that the matching algorithm
would prioritise their profiles as they are deemed sincere/real,” he adds.</p>
<p>One last nugget of wisdom from Tam: “it is not advisable to swipe right
on every profile! Such behaviours are common among scammers and are automatically
assigned red flags on such profiles.”</p>
