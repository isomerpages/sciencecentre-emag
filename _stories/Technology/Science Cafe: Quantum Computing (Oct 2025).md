<p>Today's computers encode data in binary digits—bits that are either 0s
or 1s—but the computers of the future could potentially use quantum bits,
or qubits, that can exist in a state of 0, 1, or both simultaneously. This
seemingly impossible property could result in unmatched processing power.</p>
<p>To promote public awareness of how quantum technologies could enable these
breakthroughs, Science Centre Singapore held The Quantum Café—Sip, Chat,
and Compute on Friday 10 October 2025, in collaboration with the <a href="https://www.cqt.sg/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Centre for Quantum Technologies</a>.</p>
<p>Hosted at <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/tech/new-exhibition-in-science-centre-aims-to-demystify-quantum-science" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Quanta School</a>,
Science Centre's latest exhibition on quantum science, attendees enjoyed
a buffet dinner and wine whilst mingling with other science enthusiasts
and listening to talks by two quantum experts: Dr Pooja Jayachandran (Staff
Scientist, Horizon Quantum) and Dr Alexander Hue (Outreach Manager in Education,
Centre for Quantum Technologies).</p>
<p>This October 2025 edition of Science Centre Singapore's <a href="https://www.science.edu.sg/whats-on/workshops-activities/science-cafe" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Science Café</a> series—a
monthly dinner-and-seminar event for adults aged eighteen and above—also
marked the <a href="https://www.unesco.org/en/years/quantum-science-technology" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">International Year of Quantum Science and Technology</a>.</p>

<h4><strong>Exploring the Quantum World</strong></h4>
<p>As part of the evening, attendees explored the Quanta School exhibition
after hours. Designed as a topsy-turvy classroom where things behave strangely,
participants interacted with various exhibits demystifying quantum mechanics,
from an atomic clock model to laser beam manipulations replicating Thomas
Young's 1801 <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/science/what-is-the-double-slit-experiment-and-why-is-it-so-important" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">double-slit experiment</a>—one
of the fundamental demonstrations proving that light and matter can exhibit
both wave-like and particle-like behaviours.

<h4><strong>Bubble Computers and Natural Solutions</strong></h4>
<p>To kick off the night, Dr Alexander Hue presented participants with an
intriguing brainteaser. He challenged them to imagine being architects
attempting to connect cities with the least amount of road. Whilst participants
could work through the complex mathematics to find the solution, Dr Hue
offered an elegant alternative: tubs of soapy water for dipping physical
models of city maps.</p>
<p>Dr Hue explained that since bubbles naturally minimise their surface area,
the soap film forming between pegs representing cities would reveal the
optimal way to connect them with minimal road length. This hands-on "bubble
computer" activity illustrated <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/institute-for-quantum-computing/outreach/quantum-101/qist/quantum-simulation" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">quantum simulation</a>—the
approach of building quantum systems that use physics to solve real-world
problems without requiring complicated computations.</p>

<h4><strong>From Bits to Qubits</strong></h4>
<p>Building on this foundation, Dr Pooja Jayachandran's talk, "Quantum Computing:
From Bits to Qubits, and Everything in Between!" explored the advantages
of quantum computers, fundamental quantum mechanics principles, and historical
parallels between classical computer development and today's quantum computing
revolution.</p>
<p>To illustrate quantum computing's transformative potential, Dr Jayachandran
presented a compelling thought experiment: searching through an unsorted
telephone directory containing one million names. With classical computers—or
searching by hand—the best approach requires checking entries sequentially,
one by one. On average, you would need to examine roughly 500,000 entries
before finding your target name, representing what computer scientists
call a linear search problem.</p>
<p>"However, with a quantum computer, you can do that in about a thousand
queries," Dr Jayachandran explained. This dramatic reduction—from 500,000
queries to just 1,000—demonstrates quantum computing's ability to achieve
"exponential speed-ups" for certain types of problems.</p>
<p>Whilst fully functional quantum computers capable of such feats remain
under development, Dr Jayachandran emphasised that this example represents
the extraordinary computational power we could theoretically harness through
quantum systems.</p>

<h4><strong>The "Spooky" Physics Behind Quantum Computing</strong></h4>
<p>But how do quantum computers achieve such remarkable performance? Dr Jayachandran
detailed how these advantages stem from two fundamental quantum principles:
superposition and entanglement.</p>
<p>To explain superposition, Dr Jayachandran used the analogy of a spinning
coin. She explained, "Let's say you have a coin, just a normal coin, but
instead of heads and tails, you have a zero and one on its faces. And let's
say you were tossing this coin right now—it's spinning, it's in the air.
However, if you had a quantum coin that's being tossed, it is in principle
both zero and one—strange, right—at the same time." Whilst Dr Jayachandran
acknowledged that this imaginary quantum coin was an imperfect analogy,
she conveyed the mind-bending nature of this concept, admitting "we can't
really imagine something actually being in both those states at once."</p>
<p>The second principle, entanglement, is what Albert Einstein famously described
as "<a href="https://www.astronomy.com/science/what-is-quantum-entanglement-a-physicist-explains-einsteins-spooky-action-at-a-distance/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">spooky action at a distance</a>."
Dr Jayachandran explained that "quantum entanglement is a physical phenomenon
where two or more particles become linked in such a way that the state
of one instantly affects the state of another, no matter how far apart
they are."</p>
<p>To illustrate this concept, Dr Jayachandran walked participants through
another thought experiment involving two people, Alice and Bob, who each
receive boxes containing either a green or blue ball. Even if the boxes
were at opposite ends of the universe, entangled particles would always
exist in correlated states. If Alice opens her box to reveal a green ball,
Bob will invariably find a blue ball in his box, and vice versa. For quantum
computing, this means that qubits can be linked as one system, so information
about one qubit automatically provides information about its entangled
partner.</p>
<h4><strong>Progress and Parallels</strong></h4>
<p>Dr Jayachandran concluded her presentation by acknowledging that whilst
"today's quantum computers aren't yet useful for solving hard problems,"
researchers are "making progress every single day." She noted that "history
may be rhyming," pointing to several parallels between classical and quantum
computing development.</p>
<p>For instance, classical computing initially gained attention for breaking
encryption during World War II, such as cracking the Enigma machine. Similarly,
quantum computing's early theoretical breakthrough was Shor's algorithm,
which demonstrated the potential to break current encryption methods. Additionally,
Dr Jayachandran mentioned that quantum computing's qubit count has been
doubling every eight to nine months, surpassing Moore's Law, which governed
the doubling of transistors in classical computing every two years.</p>
<h4><strong>Practical Applications and Future Possibilities</strong></h4>
<p>Dr Jayachandran's presentation was followed by Dr Hue's talk, "So You
Have A Quantum Computer! …Now What?" in which he explored the practical
applications of quantum computing. Dr Hue began by defining <a href="https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/what-is-quantum-supremacy" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">quantum supremacy</a> as
the point where "for a specific task, quantum computers can solve it faster
than any classical computer"—exemplified by Dr Jayachandran's telephone
directory search demonstration.</p>
<p>Quantum computing could particularly revolutionise materials science,
biomedical research, and drug discovery. Dr Hue referenced <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nphys2258" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Richard Feynman's insight</a> that
"nature isn't classical, and if you want to make a simulation of nature,
you better make it quantum mechanical." Consequently, Dr Hue explained,
"quantum computers can help design better materials and cures, understand
biomolecules, or even increase the rate of chemical processes." Beyond
these scientific applications, quantum computers could optimise financial
portfolios, minimise delivery route times, and factor large numbers for
cryptography.</p>

</p>
<h4><strong>Looking Towards Tomorrow</strong></h4>
<p>Dr Hue acknowledged that current quantum computers are large and impractical
for everyday use, but suggested that technological advances may lead to
miniaturisation. He referenced a statement attributed to former IBM chairman
Thomas J. Watson, who <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/532605/worst_tech_predictions.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">allegedly said</a> in
1943 that there was "a world market for maybe five computers," to illustrate
how difficult it can be to anticipate rapid technological development.</p>
<p>"Quantum computers may someday be in our pocket—we don't know yet, but
we hope," Dr Hue said.</p>
<p>He explained that "even without a quantum computer, developing quantum
algorithms, which inherently use different logic, is already helping us
think of different approaches for classical computers."</p>
<p>To conclude the evening, attendees tackled quantum programming puzzles
developed by Dr Hue, gaining hands-on familiarity with the basic principles
behind quantum algorithms.</p>
