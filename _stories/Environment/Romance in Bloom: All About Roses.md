<p>Roses have long symbolized Valentine's Day, even more than heart-shaped
chocolates or cuddly teddy bears. The trade group Society of American Florists
estimates that <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/02/13/business/roses-flowers-valentines-day/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>more than 250 million roses</u></a> alone
are produced just for 14 February. This captivating bloom garners big bucks
- the international rose trade market amounted to<a href="https://www.spglobal.com/market-intelligence/en/news-insights/research/festival-favour-and-freight-global-rose-trade" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u> 4.58 billion USD</u></a> in
2020.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's get to the roots of these beautiful plants, tracing their journey
from ancient origins to modern-day symbols of love.</p>
<p>How did the tradition of giving roses for Valentine’s Day start? In 19th-century
England, it became fashionable to send elaborate floral bouquets as <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/how-flowerobsessed-victorians-encoded-messages-in-bouquets" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>secret messages</u></a>.
Each flower and colour was paired with a particular emotion, with red roses
signifying love.&nbsp;</p>

</p>
<p>Since red dye was expensive at the time, red roses were also associated
with <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/655113/why-do-we-give-red-roses-valentines-day" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>luxury</u></a>.
Botanists experimented with new rose varieties to meet consumer demands.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One famous rose cultivar is the American Beauty Rose. Bred by Henri Lédéchaux
in France in 1875, the American Beauty spread across the northeastern United
States with its deep pink and crimson colours. Bestowed with the nickname
<a href="https://time.com/5519476/roses-symbol-love-valentines-day/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>“millionaire’s rose”</u>
</a>for its hefty price in the 1800s, this classic variety continues to be
a popular Valentine’s Day purchase to this day.</p>
<p>The scientific definition of a rose is <a href="https://www.britannica.com/question/What-is-a-rose" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>a woody perennial flowering plant in the genus </u></a><em><a href="https://www.britannica.com/question/What-is-a-rose" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Rosa</u></a></em>.
The <em>Rosa</em> genus includes approximately 100 species of perennial shrubs
in the rose family <em><a href="https://www.britannica.com/plant/Rosaceae" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Rosaceae</u></a></em>.
Roses are closely affiliated with several other economically important
members in <em>Rosaceae</em>, from food crops like almonds (<em>Prunus dulcis</em>)
and strawberries (<em>Fragaria</em> species) to ornamentals like hawthorns
(<em>Pyracantha</em> species) and crab apples (<em>Malus </em>species).&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the Valentine’s Day rose-gifting tradition may have flourished in
Europe, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/plant/rose-plant" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>most rose species are native to Asia</u></a>.
According to fossil records, roses originated in Central Asia approximately
<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4551085/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>thirty million years ago</u>
</a>.&nbsp;</p>

the Chinese, Egyptians, Greeks and Romans helped pioneer rose cultivation.
In fact, the<a href="https://www.kew.org/plants/roses" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u> first rose garden</u></a> was
created in China 5,000 years ago, and Chinese garden roses as old as the

</a>had "five-petaled flowers, distinctive oval serrated leaves and colourful
hips," qualities that persist in contemporary wild rose species. Today

<p>While English idioms like “there is no rose without a thorn” are common
and there are countless songs about the dangers of love’s sharp spikes,
<a href="https://libanswers.nybg.org/faq/222797" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>roses actually don’t have thorns</u>
</a>. In botanical language, those pokey bits sticking out from the stem are
actually prickles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What’s the difference? In plant science terms, thorns refer to the “sharp
woody points of certain shrubs and trees”, while prickles “form from the
skin of the plant, similar to how hair grows” according to <a href="https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2024/08/01/science/rose-thorn-prickles-evolution-study" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>CNN</u></a>.
These prickles help <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/08/01/science/rose-thorn-prickles-evolution-study/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>defend roses</u></a> against
animals who would otherwise chomp on them.</p>

<p>If finding your life partner is a thorny subject for you this Valentine’s
Day,&nbsp;you may find comfort that you’ll never truly be alone in the
fascinating world of plant genetics. Recent research has uncovered how
similar features like prickles emerge amongst unrelated plant species.
A <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ado1663" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>2024 study published in </u></a><em><a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ado1663" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Science</u></a></em> concluded
that one ancient gene family called "Lonely Guy" is responsible for the
prickles in many diverse plants such as roses and <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adr2473" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>other key crops such as wild eggplant, cucumber, and rice</u></a> that
evolved over millions of years. Quite an impressive legacy for a "Lonely
Guy"!&nbsp;</p>
<p>While roses have developed prickles and showy, vibrant flowers, they've
also developed features that make them irresistible to humans beyond their
visual appeal. These versatile plants have found their way into our culinary
traditions, proving that roses can be a feast for both the eyes and the
palate.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.britannica.com/plant/rose-plant" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Rose hips</u></a>—the
berrylike floral cup which contains the rose’s seeds—are high in vitamin
C and natural sugars. These nutritious fruits were a valuable ingredient
during <a href="https://www.kew.org/plants/roses" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>World War II</u></a> for
syrups. But the culinary uses of roses don't stop there. Rose water—water
flavoured by being steeped in rose petals—is used to cook delicious South
Asian sweets like laddoo and gulab jamun. In Singapore and Malaysia, the
bright pink, refreshing bandung beverage is made by mixing evaporated milk
or condensed milk with rose syrup or cordial.</p>
<p>From their ancient origins to modern cultivation, roses continue to enchant
both scientists and romantics alike. Beyond being symbols of love, roses
are living chronicles of cultural exchange and scientific discovery.</p>
