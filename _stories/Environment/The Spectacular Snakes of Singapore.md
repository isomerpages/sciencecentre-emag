<p>Wishing you prosperity and wisdom this Year of the Snake! To celebrate
this Chinese zodiac animal's charm and intelligence, we're surveying what
makes snakes so impressive and learning about the fascinating snake species
you can find right here in Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Snakes exhibit some special qualities that set them apart in the animal
kingdom. For instance, their elongated, limbless bodies are covered in
<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/reptiles/facts/snakes-1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>scales</u>
</a>made from keratin (yes, the same material as human fingernails!) that
help them to move and retain moisture. Their <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/news990812-11" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>stretchable jaws</u></a> have
flexible joints allowing them to <a href="https://thehsi.org/2015/05/06/biting-off-more-than-they-can-chew-how-snakes-swallow-large-prey/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>feed on prey much larger than their skulls</u></a>.
Their famous <a href="https://www.kqed.org/science/1982590/why-do-snakes-have-forked-tongues" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>forked tongues</u></a> let
them “smell” their surroundings to locate prey, while some snakes like
pythons even have <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2855400/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>heat-sensitive pits</u></a> that
detect infrared radiation of warm-blooded prey in the dark like thermal
imaging.</p>
<p>Although films and popular media often portray snakes as aggressive animals,
<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/reptiles/facts/snakes-1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>only a fraction</u>
</a>of the <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/reptiles/facts/snakes-1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>more than 3,000 species of snakes</u></a> worldwide
can actually kill you. Strangely, other seemingly innocuous animals can
be more deadly. A <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/imj.13297" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>2016 study</u></a> from
University of Melbourne found that <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-38592390" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>horses, for example, killed more people from 2000-2013 than all venomous animals combined in Australia</u></a>.</p>
<p>While snakes get a bad rap and are often treated with suspicion, we need
snakes to keep our green city healthy. These reptiles play important roles
in Singapore's natural ecosystems by acting as a "biological control for
local rodent populations" and serving as "vital components of the food
web as predators of small animals and prey to larger mammals and birds"
according to <a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/-/media/wmd/for-advisories/snakes/an-advisory-on-snakes--booklet-form.ashx" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>NParks’ advisory on snakes</u></a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Snakes have adapted to Singapore's highly urbanised environments by travelling
through drains and canals to hunt rats and other animals. These <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/what-to-do-if-a-snake-sneaks-up-on-you-stay-calm-and-back-away-slowly" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>ectothermic</u></a> (cold-blooded)
creatures can be found basking on the pavement, however, they are generally
shy, preferring to <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/what-to-do-if-a-snake-sneaks-up-on-you-stay-calm-and-back-away-slowly" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>retreat away</u></a> from
humans.</p>
<p>Singapore is home to <a href="https://www.ourwildneighbours.sg/our-wild-neighbours/snakes" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>67 species</u></a> of
snakes, ranging from the tiny 20-centimeter Brahminy blind snake (<em>Ramphotyphlops braminus</em>),
one of the to the gigantic reticulated python (<em>Malayopython reticulatus</em>),
which can grow up to over <a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/avs/animals/wildlife-in-singapore/snakes" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>9 meters</u></a> in
length. Due to Singapore’s tropical climate, <a href="https://www.ourwildneighbours.sg/our-wild-neighbours/snakes" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>snakes are active all year round</u></a>.</p>
<p>While most people imagine snakes smoothly gliding on the ground, Singapore
also has arboreal snakes and fossorial snakes. Arboreal snakes reside in
trees, while fossorial snakes spend most of their lives underground. The
<a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/fauna/8/3/830" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>painted bronzeback</u>
</a>, for example, is arboreal and feeds on lizards and frogs. In contrast,
the small <a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/fauna/8/1/811" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Brahminy Blind Snake</u></a> is
fossorial and feeds on soil-dwelling invertebrates such as ant or termite
larvae, often being mistaken for an earthworm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many other curious and captivating snakes native to Singapore.
Consider the <a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/fauna/4/8/481" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>blue Malayan coral snake</u></a> (<em>Calliophis bivirgatus</em>)
which boasts<a href="https://www.singaporegeographic.com/wild-animals/blue-coral-snake" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u> the largest venom glands of any snake</u></a>,
or the rarely spotted <a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/fauna/8/3/833" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>twin-barred tree snake</u></a> (<em>Chrysopelea pelias</em>)
which can <a href="https://www.singaporegeographic.com/wild-animals/twin-barred-tree-snake" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>"glide from tree to tree by flattening its body into an aerofoil-like shape and flinging itself itself from tall trees.”</u></a> Other
cool species to explore: the puff-faced water snake, dog-toothed cat snake,
whitespotted slug snake… For more information on snakes and how to spot
them safely and ethically you can visit the <a href="https://herpsocsingapore.wordpress.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Herpetological Society of Singapore</u></a>'s

<p>If you encounter a snake in a public area, stay calm and remember that
snakes are shy creatures and will not attack unless disturbed or provoked.
Observe from a safe distance and back away slowly so the snake can retreat.
If you are at home, keep your family and pets away from the snake and leave
the doors and windows open in the room for the snake to escape. Do not
attempt to wrangle the animal and call NParks’ 24-hr Animal Response Centre
(1800-476-1600) or ACRES (9783-7782) for assistance if required. You can
