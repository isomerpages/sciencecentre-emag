<br>We’ve all heard the story of the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs
66 million years ago. But what if some dinosaurs survived this cataclysmic
event? Where could they have escaped on Earth, and what would their life
look like after the asteroid's impact?</p>
<p><em><a href="https://www.science.edu.sg/visit-us/omni-theatre/amazing-dino-world-2" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Amazing Dinoworld 2</u></a></em>,
one of <a href="https://www.science.edu.sg/visit-us/omni-theatre/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Omni-Theatre</u></a>’s
latest titles, explores new scientific revelations that some dinosaur species,
such as the sauropod Puertasaurus and the carnivorous Maip, could have
survived the asteroid and the ensuing impact winter by migrating to the
Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>The forty-minute dome movie follows the perilous journey of two juvenile
Puertasaurus as they traverse terrains beset by mega tsunamis, wildfires,
and below-freezing blizzards to reach a new home. Utilising stunning visual
effects, the film brings the colossal species that thrived in the remote
refuge of what is now Antarctica back to life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Featuring insights from the leading palaeontologists on the latest fossil
discoveries and excavations, the film blends innovative CGI, scientific
data, and storytelling to dramatise this previously unknown chapter of
dinosaur history. The documentary was produced by Japanese public broadcaster
NHK in co-production with Bonne Pioche, Curiosity, and Autentic.</p>
<p>In October 2025, the <em>Void Deck </em>team had the privilege to interview <em>Amazing Dinoworld 2 </em>director
Mr. Kazuki Ueda, facilitated by global content development senior producer
Mr. Hiroaki Katayama. Read on to learn how the filmmakers reconstructed
dinosaur movements using human actors, the challenges of shooting on-location
during COVID-19, and how over ten sounds were layered to create a dinosaur’s
fearsome roar.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>A Lifelong Quest for Dinosaur Discovery</strong></h4>

</p>
<p>Mr. Ueda, who has directed palaeontology programs for over 10 years, shared
that he has been fascinated by dinosaurs ever since childhood. He joined
NHK more than 20 years ago and initially worked on science and wildlife
programs, filming fascinating rare animals such as the Golden monkey. His
passion for dinosaurs deepened when he first joined a special program about
dinosaurs in 2006. What most appealed to him was that unlike wildlife documentaries,
which tended to be stringently factual, dinosaur programs required not
only scientific accuracy, but also a creative reconstruction of how such
giants might have once roamed the Earth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The collision and mixture of fact-based science and imagination–that’s
the most exciting part of producing a dinosaur program,” Mr. Ueda stated.</p>
<p>Longstanding collaboration with scientists like renowned palaeontologist
Dr. Yoshitsugu Kobayashi of Hokkaido University helped strike a careful
balance between hard science and imaginative filmmaking. In fact, Dr. Kobayashi
had helped introduce Mr. Ueda to new research that would spark the concept
for <em>Amazing Dinoworld 2</em>. Mr. Ueda had previously produced an NHK
special on dinosaur extinction in 2009 that featured the prevailing theory
at the time that disasters including the Impact Winter from the meteorite
killed off the dinosaurs; however, the discovery of new fossils in Alaska
by Dr. Kobayashi’s team made him eager to reassess this hypothesis.</p>
<p>Mr. Ueda described how Dr. Kobayashi’s fieldwork in Alaska “uncovered
fossilised footprints of hadrosaurs—plant-eating dinosaurs—deep within
the ancient Arctic… crucially, alongside adult footprints were the tiny
tracks of juveniles.” This “revolutionary detail” led Dr. Kobayashi to
postulate that perhaps dinosaur species with preexisting adaptations for
extreme cold might have survived the harsh temperatures following the asteroid
impact.</p>
<p>Mr. Ueda emphasised the dynamic nature of palaeontology, where new discoveries
constantly reshape understanding. “It's the most beautiful part of the
palaeontology, and being a palaeontologist, pushing those boundaries and
frontiers,” Mr. Ueda explained. Mr. Ueda drew on these emerging findings
to develop the storyboards in close collaboration with Dr. Kobayashi.</p>
<h4><strong>Recreating the Dinosaurs’ Last Refuge&nbsp;</strong></h4>

<br>The documentary team developed the narrative through consultations with
dozens of scientists around the world. An expert from the Carnegie Museum
of Natural History mentioned to the crew that the area we now know as the
South Pole would be a likely refuge site for the dinosaurs. The filmmakers
selected the Gondwana supercontinent as the setting, and chose specific
dinosaurs based on their likelihood of survival in that region. The story
evolved based on scientifically plausible plot points, such as juvenile
dinosaurs hunkering down in caves to escape the heatwave caused by the
asteroid impact.</p>
<p>Mr. Ueda explained that the team selected real locations resembling prehistoric
landscapes to serve as authentic backdrops for CG work. This approach was
not simply for realism in filming, but to reduce the complexity of CG production
and achieve a more natural texture. To create convincing dinosaurs, the
backgrounds needed to closely reflect the environments of their era. Originally,
filming was planned in the Southern Hemisphere in countries like South
America, New Zealand to match prehistoric landscapes. Due to COVID-19 travel
restrictions, locations in Japan, particularly Hokkaido, were used instead.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The grasslands of eastern Hokkaido where Mr. Ueda had filmed two decades
earlier during his time at NHK Hokkaido Branch were used for shots of the
prehistoric giants walking in the fog. Since there are significant differences
between today's flora and prehistoric plants—such as the fact that Cretaceous
plants differ from modern ones, and that the flora of the Southern Hemisphere
is distinct from that of the Northern Hemisphere—the team avoided close-up
shots of plants whenever possible, and even went to the lengths of creating
scientifically accurate CGI plants when necessary.</p>
<h4><strong>A Deeply Human Tale of Resilience&nbsp;</strong></h4>

<br>
<br>Mr. Ueda explained that it was crucial that the film went beyond a nonfictional
investigation of dinosaur extinction and presented a compelling story of
resilience that felt deeply human, despite starring nonhuman animals. To
give a reference for the animators and a sense of humanness to the dinosaur
performances, Mr. Ueda and his team layered multiple visual elements into
the eyes of the dinosaurs to convey a sense of empathy and emotion, achieving
an exceptionally high level of expression. Also, they physically acted
out dinosaur movements using 5-metre poles to simulate the dinosaur’s limbs
and head positions. For instance, the thrilling battle between the Maip
and the juvenile Puertasaurus was first played out by human actors and
then animated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another key factor in humanising the dinosaur characters was the music.
Mr. Ueda shared that he wanted the soundtrack to create the impression
that the audience was experiencing the feelings of the dinosaurs on their
dangerous journey. The lamenting piano and heart-tugging instrumentals
were composed to emotionally connect viewers with these prehistoric giants.</p>
<p>Even the dinosaur noises tapped on the emotive power of the human voice.
“For carnivorous dinosaurs, we mixed lion, tiger, bear, and human voices
to create a deep sound. For smaller dinosaurs, we used bird songs and children’s
voices,” Mr. Ueda said. The sound engineers also adapted recordings from
trumpets and metals, mixing over ten sources to create a single dinosaur’s
roar.</p>
<p>He hopes the film encourages viewers, especially children, to explore
scientific mysteries and understand that science is an ongoing journey
of discovery. Mr. Ueda explained, “It’s not the end of the story [of how
dinosaurs lived]. If you try to know more, you may find incredible stories
like this—stories of survival and hope that continue to inspire us.”</p>
