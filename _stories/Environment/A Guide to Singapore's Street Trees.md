<h4>Do you know Singapore has "cherry blossom" season too? Give yourself a screen break and try to spot the trumpet tree and other common street trees!</h4>
<p>If you're anything like me, you may be hunched over like a prawn and reading
this article on your phone. How much screen time have you had today? In
2016, the Healthy Living Index Survey found that the average <a href="https://www.healthhub.sg/live-healthy/keep-an-eye-on-it--eye-strain" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Singaporean spends a whopping 3.7 hours online, excluding time from work</a>.
It's time to go outside and touch some grass!</p>
<p>Break the monotony of staring at your screens by taking a leisurely stroll
down the street and admiring Singapore's lush scenery, or gaze out at our
tropical city from the comfort of your home. Research suggests that spending
time around trees can improve well-being and boost longevity (see this
handy primer from <a href="https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/why_trees_can_make_you_happier" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Greater Good Magazine</a>).</p>
<p>You don't even need to trek to MacRitchie Reservoir to reap the benefits.
A <a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pan3.10648" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">June 2024 study</a> in
the journal <em>People and Nature </em>found that participants who simply
looked at green elements in urban environments reported better moods and
less anxiety.</p>
<p>Hereâ€™s a little exercise to rejuvenate yourself: go to the nearest window
or strap on your walking shoes, take a deep breath, and try identifying
these eight common street trees of Singapore using the pictures below.</p>
<h4><strong>1. Rain Tree</strong></h4>
