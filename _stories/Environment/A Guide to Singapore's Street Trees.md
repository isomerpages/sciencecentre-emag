<p>Singaporeans are slowly resuming life as per normal. As shops start to
reopen, those brave enough to venture outside swiftly flock with their
SafeEntry apps in hand. But for the more cautious, they might not have
seen any other form of life except through their TV, computer, or phone
screens for 3 months and counting now.</p>
<p>Whether you fall into the former or latter, it’s time to disconnect from
technology and connect a little bit more with nature. Break the monotony
of staring at your screens by taking a leisurely stroll down the street
(with your mask on, of course!), or gaze out from the safe and sanitised
comfort of your home.</p>
<p>So here’s a little exercise: Walk over to your window or strap on your
walking shoes, take a deep breath, and try identifying these 8 common streets
trees of Singapore using only the pictures below. No cheating by searching
the trees on the internet!</p>
<h4><strong>1. Rain Tree</strong></h4>
<h4><strong>2. Yellow Flame</strong></h4>
