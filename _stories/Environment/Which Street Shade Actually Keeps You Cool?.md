<p>Picture this: you're rushing to the hawker centre for lunch on a sweltering
afternoon, and you spot two options for shade: a big tree or a bus shelter.
Which one should you choose? A <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.177864" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">2024 Singapore study</a> has
the answer, and it might surprise you.</p>
<p>An inter-university team of researchers led by the Cambridge Centre for
Advanced&nbsp;Research and Education in Singapore&nbsp;(CARES) conducted
the first comprehensive study in Singapore comparing how different types
of street shade types (such as trees, artificial structures, and mutual
shading from buildings) perform at keeping pedestrians cool. Their findings
could reshape how we design our cities and navigate our daily routes to
beat the heat.</p>
<p>Singapore's tropical climate regularly exposes residents to intense outdoor
heat. With extreme temperatures becoming more common due to climate change,
understanding effective cooling strategies is vital for public health.</p>
<p>"If we are serious about climate resilience, we must treat street shading
as essential infrastructure, particularly for vulnerable communities who
rely on public space,” says Prof. Ronita Bardhan, Professor of Sustainable
Built Environment and Health at the University of Cambridge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prof. Bardhan supervised the street shade study which was initiated by
Dr. Lei Xu when he was a visiting researcher in her research group, the
Cambridge Sustainable Design Group. The data collection was led by the
Future Cities Laboratory (FCL) Global at Singapore-ETH Centre.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Summarising the key findings from the study, Prof. Bardhan emphasised,
" Street shading is not marginal, it meaningfully lowers air temperature
by close to one degree and can improve perceived thermal comfort by three
degrees or more, directly reducing heat stress risk in exposed populations."</p>
<p>The study is part of <a href="https://www.cares.cam.ac.uk/research/hd4-project/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">CARES' Health-Driven Design for Cities (HD4) programme</a>,
which investigates how individuals live and move in Singapore, how the
urban environment shapes their exposure to health risks and how this influences
their behaviour and health outcomes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The HD4 programme will integrate environmental data with health and behaviour
data in the <a href="https://www.npm.sg/phase-ii-precise-sg100k/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SG100K</a> cohort
study, helping us understand how we might change the organisation of cities
to make them healthier for all. The research is supported by the National
Research Foundation, Prime Minister's Office, Singapore under its Campus
for Research Excellence and Technological Enterprise (CREATE) programme.</p>
<h4><strong>Heat Detectives at Work</strong></h4>
<p>To cool our cities, we first need to measure just how hot our streets
really are. However,&nbsp; heat stress has become so severe that even studying
it puts researchers at risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To protect surveyors and minimise equipment malfunctions due to overheating
batteries, the team scheduled their data collection between 2:00-4:00 PM,
rather than during the hottest part of the day. Prof. Bardhan hopes the
study serves as a “first proof of concept” of protocol design for similar
urban heat studies to collect the best data possible while ensuring safety
of participants and equipment.</p>
<p>Researchers set up monitoring equipment such as panoramic and thermal
image cameras along with heat stress trackers to collect data along selected
routes in Singapore's one-north district during a particularly hot August
afternoon in 2023. They measured air temperature, relative humidity, and
"view factors" — essentially the percentage of sky visible from a particular
spot, which is used to calculate solar radiation.</p>
<p>The results were striking: street shade reduced air temperatures by about
0.8°C on average, but the perceived cooling effect was much greater, with
an average decrease of 3.1°C according to the Universal Thermal Comfort
Index (UTCI).&nbsp;</p>
<p>More importantly, shade dramatically reduced heat stress exposure. Street
shade limited 92% of extreme heat stress occurrences and provided a 91%
reduction in areas that would otherwise experience strong heat stress.
By actively preventing exposure, the researchers found that shade reduces
very strong heat stress by 20% and strong heat stress by 12%.</p>

<h4><strong>The Winning Combination</strong></h4>
<p>So back to that hot lunchtime route dilemma — take shelter under a tree,
or a bus shelter? The answer is both. The study found that combining different
shading strategies works best. “Shade works best when it is layered,” Prof.
Bardhan explains. “Be close to a tree for natural cooling, and under a
constructed shade for direct sun protection. Together, they significantly
reduce heat exposure.”</p>
<p></p>

<p><em>Collage of a tree, a bus shelter, and an air conditioner against an orange-blue gradient background.</em>
</p>
<p>This is because trees and artificial structures cool differently. Trees
enhance ventilation and air movement, while artificial shading reduces
surface temperature and reflected heat. The magic happens when you combine
them, like that bus shelter with a large tree right next to it.</p>
<p>The researchers discovered that areas with high shade coverage — about
80% coverage from either greenery or large overhangs — provided the strongest
cooling effects, with potential temperature reductions of 3-5°C. However,
since achieving this through tree planting alone could take decades, the
researchers recommend strategically deploying a diverse mix of shade types.</p>
<h4><strong>Smart City Planning</strong></h4>
<p>The findings have immediate implications for urban planners and everyday
Singaporeans alike. For planners, the study suggests moving away from blanket
interventions across the city. Instead, they should use "view factor" analysis
— basically calculations of how much sky is visible from street level —
to identify hotspots.</p>
<p>"If you can see more of the sky and less of buildings and greenery, you
can be rest assured that that area will turn into a hotspot on a hot summer
day," Prof. Bardhan explains.</p>
<p>The research also emphasises material choices. Surface temperatures significantly
affect cooling efficacy, so selecting appropriate materials for pavements
and shading structures matters. The team recommends more permeable pavements
that integrate green elements without compromising walkability.</p>
<p>For the public, the study offers practical guidance for route planning.
Understanding which areas experience higher heat stress can help people
make better choices about destinations and pathways. The key is looking
for combinations: sheltered corridors with nearby trees, footbridges adjacent
to greenery, or pavilions in tree-lined areas.</p>
<h4><strong>The Road Ahead</strong></h4>
<p>This research represents just the beginning of a larger effort to find
sustainable solutions for climate-resilient cities enhancing health and
wellbeing. The study is the first publication to emerge from the HD4 programme,
which Prof. Bardhan notes is “probably the only project in the world today
that is looking at this intersection [of the built environment and public
health] in such an intrinsic way where we are actually linking to health
outcomes.”</p>
<p>For Prof. Bardhan, this work is deeply personal. Her vivid thermal memory
of growing up in one of India’s most densely populated cities continues
to shape her research agenda and her commitment to protecting climate vulnerable
populations.</p>
<p>“I want to understand how built environment decisions can enable precision
prevention for health,” she says. “I have seen firsthand how prolonged
heat exposure leads to serious health consequences. What concerns me most
are the communities who cannot access cooling, who cannot retreat into
air-conditioned spaces or vehicles. For them, the street, the home, and
the neighbourhood become their primary line of defence. That is where design
must intervene.”</p>
<p>This focus on equity shapes the research's broader ambitions: designing
cities that promote health for everyone through their very structure, while
reducing reliance on energy-intensive solutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The team sees Singapore as uniquely positioned to lead this global effort.
"If Singapore can be a forerunner in these interventions, the world will
pick it up," Prof. Bardhan says, pointing to the island nation's combination
of tropical climate, urban density, and strong government support for evidence-based
policy.</p>
<p>Urban transformation starts with understanding what works on the ground.
So next time you're planning that lunch route, remember: the best shade
isn't just about coverage — it's about combination. Your ideal refuge combines
the ventilation benefits of trees with the surface cooling of artificial
structures. Science has spoken, and it says that bus shelter next to the
tree is your best bet.</p>
