<p><em>Walking With Dinosaurs</em>, one of the most iconic brands in television
history since 1999, is back on BBC Earth, produced by the award-winning
BBC Studios Science Unit. The series follows six incredible dinosaurs like
never before featuring stories based on the latest science. By examining
the bones left behind and making comparative analyses, the show reveals
the secrets of how some prehistoric giants once lived, hunted, fought,
and died.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The editorial team of Void Deck was privileged to interview Thomas Scott,
Head of Development at BBC Studios Science Unit, and Dr. Nizar Ibrahim,
a vertebrate paleontologist and comparative anatomist featured in Episode
2 of the series. Episode 2 follows the journey of a Spinosaurus named Sobek,
at the edge of the Moroccan Sahara, as he takes on the role of being a
new dad in search for a new home with an abundant food source for the family.
Things take a turn when they face a deadly confrontation.</p>

<p>The name Spinosaurus may not immediately ring a bell with audiences, but
Spinosaurus can be even bigger than the more popular Tyrannosaurus Rex,
and is unique in its traits that enable it to spend most of its time in
the water. It has a <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.thoughtco.com/why-did-spinosaurus-have-a-sail-1092007&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1750833905906266&amp;usg=AOvVaw1qhcLA9kTWRgsTsLfN-DMy" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">sail</a> over
2 metres tall on its back (yes, a sail!), a paddle tail, and webbed feet.
These features were perfect for the rivers and swamps in ancient Morocco.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The following interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>VD: What was it like working with the VFX and CGI team? Was there anything memorable or challenging in order to get the dinosaurs accurate?</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>DR. NIZAR IBRAHIM</strong>: There are lots of challenges because
the creatures you're bringing back are so unlike anything alive today.
It's really challenging. I mean, they look like impossible animals, you
know? Even the ones we're really familiar with – the big, long necked dinosaurs
– it weighs 80 tons, and it's got a head that's the size of a horse's.
It's just bizarre, right? When you’re working on these animals, it’s a
little bit like what you might see in some science fiction movie where
they’re dissecting and doing an alien autopsy to try and figure out what
that creature was like.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>So describing the fossils is one thing that we, as paleontologists, are
very comfortable with. But fleshing it out and having it move around raises
all sorts of really complex questions.</p>
<p></p>

</p>
<p>Nonetheless, my experience was really good working with the VFX people
because they understood movement and weight – how would an animal that
weighs seven, eight, nine tons actually move around? Plus, they understood
animals, and how animals navigate their world. Still, we had some really
big challenges trying to figure out how some of these creatures would be,
for example, swimming and interacting with other members of their own species.
So, it was really good because sometimes you work with a VFX team who are
technically good but lack that understanding.</p>
<p></p>
<p>With this team, it was a real pleasure because we also had a large science
team. So, there are a lot of people with a good understanding of biomechanics
and so on.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And it’s a really exciting moment when you see the creatures you've been
working on for years and years and years come to life. That’s essentially
what we’re trying to do as paleontologists. We’re trying to resurrect creatures
from lost worlds, from the deep past of our planet. But really, resurrecting
them is something you can only do when you’re working with Tom and others
at the BBC that are really fleshing them out on screen. It was a real thrill.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>VD: From the fossils, how do you determine the outer characteristics and behaviour of the dinosaurs of that time?&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>DR. NIZAR IBRAHIM</strong>: Well, sometimes we do get soft tissue
preserved. It doesn't happen very often, but sometimes we have skin texture
preserved. So we know, for example, that some dinosaurs had feathers, but
others had scaly, pebbly skin. We know exactly what the shape of the scales
was and everything. On some very rare occasions, we actually have parts
of, for example, the digestive tract preserved in a small, little predatory
dinosaur.&nbsp;</p>

</p>
<p>We also do a lot of comparative anatomy. We dissect the tails of alligators,
for example, to understand the big tail muscles which are present in dinosaurs.
Birds are living dinosaurs, but they don't really have these big fleshy
tails anymore, right? So we have to look at crocs to understand these big
muscles in order to reconstruct them fairly accurately. We’ll go, “Oh,
this is the muscle that attaches to the thigh bone and the base of the
tail.” Now that we are using a lot of digital tools, we can build a volumetric
model of a dinosaur and reconstruct the basic outline around the bones
in a very accurate fashion so that we can then weigh the dinosaurs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<br>For the behaviour, we have some really cool contextual evidence. We have
bite marks on the skulls of some dinosaurs. We know that they would do
something called face biting, for example. We have really good evidence,
in some cases, on dinosaur nesting grounds. We have dinosaur footprints
which tell us something about whether a certain type of dinosaur is moving
around in large herds, for example. And again, we can look at living animals.
We know the dinosaurs had amazing display structures like frills and crests
and sails. And we know that birds use display structures in all sorts of
interesting ways. So there's a lot we can reconstruct with a relatively
high degree of confidence, beyond the bones.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>[Thomas Scott then shares his screen to show the difference between the Utahraptor from the 1999 Walking with Dinosaurs series and the Utahraptor from the series this time. The former has more scaly skin while the latter has more feathery textures.]</em>
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>THOMAS SCOTT</strong>: It’s just so visually impressive and stunning
how much the science has moved on.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>VD: So, the fossils point to how they behave and the characteristics they have, but how do you construct the stories? For each episode, we follow a dinosaur as it goes through a journey or an experience where there is some ‘drama’. How much of these are creative inputs and how much are derived from the archeological findings?</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>THOMAS SCOTT</strong>: We wanted everything to be as grounded
in science as possible and create those sorts of natural history stories.
There's definitely an element of using your storytelling imagination. But
for every episode, we worked with the individual paleontologists who were
digging up the creature that was in the ground. We worked with evidence
from the dig site and other dig sites, and then studied comparative behaviours
in creatures today. So we worked in parallel with our scientists to create
these natural history moments and stories.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>I remember myself and Nizar working together on the Spinosaurus story
from the beginning. At some point, we were discussing how the Carcharodontosaurus,
that also shows up in the spinosaurus story, is maybe smaller but more
agile, and got feet with designs for working best on the ground as opposed
to swimming in water.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also discussed where our Spinosaurus would be going, which we linked
to the migration of the prehistoric sawskate fish – one of the Spinosaurus’
sources of food. So we were working with our scientists and all the evidence
available to create these stories, that are as rooted in science and fact
as it is possible to be. The first series (1999) did exactly the same thing
but they never had the opportunity to show you some of that evidence coming
out of the dig site. So this time, much of the story is motivated by our
fossils that we’re seeing and the creatures it meets along the way – creatures
that we have evidence for, either from our dig site or in the local area.
So it's all embedded in science, but with that sort of little bit of storytelling
magic to create something exciting and fun that kids are going to love
and enjoy and keep watching.&nbsp;</p>
