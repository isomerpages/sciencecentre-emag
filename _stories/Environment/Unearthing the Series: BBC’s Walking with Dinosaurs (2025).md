<p><em>Walking With Dinosaurs</em>, one of the most iconic brands in television
history since 1999, is back on BBC Earth, produced by the award-winning
BBC Studios Science Unit. The series follows six incredible dinosaurs like
never before featuring stories based on the latest science. By examining
the bones left behind and making comparative analyses, the show reveals
the secrets of how some prehistoric giants once lived, hunted, fought,
and died.</p>
<p>The editorial team of <em>Void Deck</em> was privileged to interview Thomas
Scott, Head of Development at BBC Studios Science Unit, and Dr. Nizar Ibrahim,
a vertebrate paleontologist and comparative anatomist featured in Episode
2 of the series. Episode 2 follows the journey of a Spinosaurus named Sobek,
at the edge of the Moroccan Sahara, as he takes on the role of being a
new dad in search for a new home with an abundant food source for the family.
Things take a turn when they face a deadly confrontation.</p>

</p>
<p>The name Spinosaurus may not immediately ring a bell with audiences, but
Spinosaurus can be even bigger than the more popular Tyrannosaurus Rex,
and is unique in its traits that enable it to spend most of its time in
the water. It has a <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/why-did-spinosaurus-have-a-sail-1092007" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">sail</a> over
2 metres tall on its back (yes, a sail!), a paddle tail, and webbed feet.
These features were perfect for the rivers and swamps in ancient Morocco.</p>
<p><em>The following interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.</em>
</p>
<p><strong>VD: What was it like working with the VFX and CGI team? Was there anything memorable or challenging in order to get the dinosaurs accurate?</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>DR. NIZAR IBRAHIM</strong>: There are lots of challenges because
the creatures you're bringing back are so unlike anything alive today.
It's really challenging. I mean, they look like impossible animals, you
know? Even the ones we're really familiar with – the big, long necked dinosaurs
– it weighs 80 tons, and it's got a head that's the size of a horse's.
It's just bizarre, right? When you’re working on these animals, it’s a
little bit like what you might see in some science fiction movie where
they’re dissecting and doing an alien autopsy to try and figure out what
that creature was like.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So describing the fossils is one thing that we, as paleontologists, are
very comfortable with. But fleshing it out and having it move around raises
all sorts of really complex questions.</p>
<p></p>

</p>
<p>Nonetheless, my experience was really good working with the VFX people
because they understood movement and weight – how would an animal that
weighs seven, eight, nine tons actually move around? Plus, they understood
animals, and how animals navigate their world. Still, we had some really
big challenges trying to figure out how some of these creatures would be,
for example, swimming and interacting with other members of their own species.
So, it was really good because sometimes you work with a VFX team who are
technically good but lack that understanding.</p>
<p>With this team, it was a real pleasure because we also had a large science
team. So, there are a lot of people with a good understanding of biomechanics
and so on.</p>
<p>And it’s a really exciting moment when you see the creatures you've been
working on for years and years and years come to life. That’s essentially
what we’re trying to do as paleontologists. We’re trying to resurrect creatures
from lost worlds, from the deep past of our planet. But really, resurrecting
them is something you can only do when you’re working with Tom and others
at the BBC that are really fleshing them out on screen. It was a real thrill.</p>
<p><strong>VD: From the fossils, how do you determine the outer characteristics and behaviour of the dinosaurs of that time?&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>DR. NIZAR IBRAHIM</strong>: Well, sometimes we do get soft tissue
preserved. It doesn't happen very often, but sometimes we have skin texture
preserved. So we know, for example, that some dinosaurs had feathers, but
others had scaly, pebbly skin. We know exactly what the shape of the scales
was and everything. On some very rare occasions, we actually have parts
of, for example, the digestive tract preserved in a small, little predatory
dinosaur.&nbsp;</p>

</p>
<p>We also do a lot of comparative anatomy. We dissect the tails of alligators,
for example, to understand the big tail muscles which are present in dinosaurs.
Birds are living dinosaurs, but they don't really have these big fleshy
tails anymore, right? So we have to look at crocs to understand these big
muscles in order to reconstruct them fairly accurately. We’ll go, “Oh,
this is the muscle that attaches to the thigh bone and the base of the
tail.” Now that we are using a lot of digital tools, we can build a volumetric
model of a dinosaur and reconstruct the basic outline around the bones
in a very accurate fashion so that we can then weigh the dinosaurs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the behaviour, we have some really cool contextual evidence. We have
bite marks on the skulls of some dinosaurs. We know that they would do
something called face biting, for example. We have really good evidence,
in some cases, on dinosaur nesting grounds. We have dinosaur footprints
which tell us something about whether a certain type of dinosaur is moving
around in large herds, for example. And again, we can look at living animals.
We know the dinosaurs had amazing display structures like frills and crests
and sails. And we know that birds use display structures in all sorts of
interesting ways. So there's a lot we can reconstruct with a relatively
high degree of confidence, beyond the bones.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>[Thomas Scott then shares his screen to show the difference between the Utahraptor from the 1999 Walking with Dinosaurs series and the Utahraptor from the series this time. The former has more scaly skin while the latter has more feathery textures.]</em>
</p>
<p><strong>THOMAS SCOTT</strong>: It’s just so visually impressive and stunning
how much the science has moved on.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>VD: So, the fossils point to how they behave and the characteristics they have, but how do you construct the stories? For each episode, we follow a dinosaur as it goes through a journey or an experience where there is some ‘drama’. How much of these are creative inputs and how much are derived from the archeological findings?</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>THOMAS SCOTT</strong>: We wanted everything to be as grounded
in science as possible and create those sorts of natural history stories.
There's definitely an element of using your storytelling imagination. But
for every episode, we worked with the individual paleontologists who were
digging up the creature that was in the ground. We worked with evidence
from the dig site and other dig sites, and then studied comparative behaviours
in creatures today. So we worked in parallel with our scientists to create
these natural history moments and stories.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I remember myself and Nizar working together on the Spinosaurus story
from the beginning. At some point, we were discussing how the Carcharodontosaurus,
that also shows up in the spinosaurus story, is maybe smaller but more
agile, and got feet with designs for working best on the ground as opposed
to swimming in water.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also discussed where our Spinosaurus would be going, which we linked
to the migration of the prehistoric sawskate fish – one of the Spinosaurus’
sources of food. So we were working with our scientists and all the evidence
available to create these stories, that are as rooted in science and fact
as it is possible to be. The first series (1999) did exactly the same thing
but they never had the opportunity to show you some of that evidence coming
out of the dig site. So this time, much of the story is motivated by our
fossils that we’re seeing and the creatures it meets along the way – creatures
that we have evidence for, either from our dig site or in the local area.
So it's all embedded in science, but with that sort of little bit of storytelling
magic to create something exciting and fun that kids are going to love
and enjoy and keep watching.&nbsp;</p>

</p>
<p><strong>DR. NIZAR IBRAHIM</strong>: Ultimately, we wanted to create stories
that are plausible. As you say, there's quite a bit of drama. But we know
that animals experience a lot of drama in their lives. Often we just see
traces of that drama. If you look at a big, great white shark, you see
all these scars and you know that some dramatic things happened, even if
we're not there to witness them. You see a limping lion, with all sorts
of scars and you can tell that a lot of things happened to this animal.
We basically condensed that concept into an amazing narrative arc for each
one of our key characters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the case of Spinosaurus, we have the animal moving from one place to
another in search of more abundant food. Now, we know that that's something
animals do. Crocs do it. Birds do it. All sorts of animals do it. And that's
really what it boils down to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The anatomy of Spinosaurus is all about catching things in the water.
It has these crocodile-like jaws. It has the paddle tail and everything.
And most importantly, all the prey captured are largely aquatic animals.
So it makes sense for this animal to spend a lot of time in the water.
One of the most abundant fish in this environment was the sawskate. In
fact, we even found some bits of the sawskate on the jawbones of our Spinosaurus.
It's a series of things we know would have happened to the Spinosaurus
and arranging them in a story. At no point did we put anything where I
felt would be implausible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, that's one of the really cool things, because I think a lot of people
go into these kinds of programs with a story in mind and they go like,
“We want this dinosaur to do this.” What we did here is we said, well,
let's look at the fossils, and build a story around the fossils. And that's
a very, very powerful way of telling a story. It turns out the fossils
tell us a lot of amazing things. Sometimes it's not necessarily the story
they had in mind when they first started sketching this out. But then they
realized, wow, this is actually really, really cool. I think we really
managed to build everything around the actual fossils.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>VD: Episode 2 of Walking in Dinosaurs takes place in the Sahara Desert. Are dinosaurs actually well spread out over the Earth?&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>DR. NIZAR IBRAHIM</strong>: Dinosaurs had global reign, so you
find them everywhere. You find them in the Sahara, in the Arctic. But it
depends, because at certain times, much of the UK, for example, was underwater.
So you find very few dinosaur fossils in those intervals – only the ones
that floated out from the ocean. But at other times, you can find lots
of them. Ultimately, they had a global distribution.</p>
<p>And the reign of dinosaurs is actually quite different from the reign
of mammals today. 100 million years ago, the Sahara had an abundance of
predators. That’s very different from what we see now. In the rich biodiversity
hotspots of Africa, predators: lions, hyenas, cheetahs and so on, only
represent a tiny percentage of the mammal biomass. There are more zebras,
wildebeest, and cape buffaloes. But what we see in the Sahara is like an
upside-down food web with all these giant predators, making it the most
dangerous place in the history of the planet Earth. And the question is,
what were all these predators feeding on? Now we know that many of them
were specialized fish eaters. Many of the flying reptiles, crocs, and creatures
like the Spinosaurus relied on the river with its abundant food source.
That’s what we’re slowly piecing together, and that’s one of the cool things
about the age of dinosaurs. It’s quite different and quite alien. It’s
not simply replicating what mammal ecosystems do today.</p>
<p><strong>VD: If you could be a dinosaur, what would it be?</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>THOMAS SCOTT</strong>: If I was a dinosaur from this series, my
absolute favourite is this big giant sauropod. I love the fact that he’s
massive and almost completely invulnerable to everything around him, so
his life story plays out at a completely different speed to all of the
other dinosaurs.</p>
<p></p>

</p>
<p>A lot of our shows have a predator and prey. There’s a chase. There’s
an urgency. Whereas his is kind of a love story, playing out at the speed
of the life of a sauropod. It was kind of slow and majestic and had a lot
of appeal. So the idea of just sort of living at my own pace, not having
to worry too much about some of the other things in the ecosystem, sounds
lovely.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>DR. NIZAR IBRAHIM</strong>: Thomas picked one of the dinosaurs
with the smallest brains in the history of the group. So, I might pick
something at the other end of the spectrum. It would probably be a predatory
dinosaur. Simply because there were really diverse animals – they have
this interesting bird link. It could be almost any of them, but I would
pick Spinosaurus. I just like the idea of being a predatory dinosaur that
can actually go into the water and terrify all sorts of creatures in the
river system, and then get out of the water from time to time. It’s like
the giant shark in jaws, except that it can actually just walk out of the
water. I think that’s quite an interesting kind of amphibious lifestyle
to explore.</p>
