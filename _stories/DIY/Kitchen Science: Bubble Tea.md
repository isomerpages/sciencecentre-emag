<p>Someone once asked me, ‘Why bubble tea? What’s so great about it?’ Are
you kidding me? Can’t say the same for everyone, but at least for me, bubble
tea solves everything (not literally everything, but you get me). It’s
both a drink and a snack at the same time, which means if you’re hungry
and thirsty, bubble tea will solve the problem.</p>
<p>If you’re happy, bubble tea is there to celebrate the joy with you. If
you’re sad, bubble tea will wash those tears away. If you’re stressed,
bubble tea will help ease the pain. I’m sure you get the gist of it all
by now – bubble tea is life!</p>

<p>But how is this marvelous drink made? I am going to share with you some
tips and tricks that I have picked up along the way for making your very
own chewy pearls!</p>
<p>All you need is just three basic ingredients: brown sugar, water and most
importantly tapioca starch, in an estimated ratio of 1:2:4. Not to mention
having lots of time and patience – it is tedious work for the love of pearls.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

</div>
<p>First, dissolve the brown sugar in boiling water before adding half of
the tapioca starch to thicken the mixture. Once it thickens, remove it
from the heat. Add and mix in the remaining tapioca starch until it starts
to come together to form a dough. The trick here is to ensure that the
water is boiling before adding in the tapioca starch so that starch gelatinisation
can occur to form a dough. Otherwise, it turns into a non-Newtonian fluid,
which will then melt into a sad blob when you try to shape your pearls.</p>

</div>
<p>Once your dough is formed (and still warm), sprinkle some tapioca starch
on a clean flat surface. This is where you will knead it till the texture
resembles play-doh. If it is too sticky, add more tapioca starch into the
dough. It will never become dry as you continue to knead the dough.</p>
<p>Next comes the arduous journey of rolling each individual pearl with love
and patience. If you want those pearls, you’ve got to work for them, right?</p>
<p>Divide the dough into 4 equal parts. Roll them out into long and thin
cylinders about 1cm in diameter (depends on how big or small you like your
pearls), and cut them into small blocks to roll them into spheres. The
untouched dough can dry up over time; you may want to wrap the remaining
dough with cling wrap to keep it moist.</p>
<p>When you are done painstakingly rolling each pearl, shower them with some
tapioca starch (and love) to prevent them from sticking together. Pro-tip:
kids who are bored at home could be of great help!</p>

</div>
<p>Now you’re ready to cook those pearls! But wait, if you wish to save some
for the future, you may keep them in the freezer for up to 6 months. When
you have decided how much of your stash to ration out, pour the pearls
into a pot of furiously boiling water, stirring as you do so to prevent
them from sticking to each other. Once they start to float in the water,
you can lower the heat and stir occasionally.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/BobaBoiling.gif">
</div>
<p>There are a few variations for cooking the pearls. You may choose to boil
your pearls for about 15 to 20 minutes (depending on their size), after
which you will transfer them into ice water. You may also choose to simmer
the pearls for another 30 mins at low heat with the lid on before transferring
them into ice water. Placing the pearls in ice water after cooking makes
them bouncier and chewier!</p>

<p>
<br>Once the pearls have cooled, drain off the excess water. You may choose
to drizzle honey over your pearls or sprinkle sugar on your pearls to give
them a little more sweetness and flavour. Let it soak for a while, et voilà
your pearls are ready to be served with your favourite milk tea.</p>

<p>As you enjoy your cup of bubble tea, you may wonder how this cup of happiness
came about.</p>
<p>Bubble tea, also known as boba tea, or 珍珠奶茶<em>zhēn zhū nǎi chá</em> (pearl
milk tea) all refer to the same thing – our favourite pastime drink – tea-based
drink mixed with milk or flavoured syrups with tapioca pearl topping. However,
the original bubble milk tea doesn’t contain pearls; the term ‘bubble’
in bubble tea actually refers to the froth you get after shaking the drink!</p>
<p>There are some speculations about the origins of bubble tea, but one seems
to stand out: bubble tea originates from the city of Taichung, Taiwan in
the 1980s, from the Chen Shui Tang tea shop where the owner Mr Liu Han-chien
sold his high mountain oolong tea.</p>
<p>As Taiwanese tea stands became increasingly popular and competitive, Mr
Liu wanted to set himself apart. Inspired by iced Japanese coffee, he wanted
to change the way people drank tea, so he experimented by putting traditional
milk tea in a cocktail shaker with ice and served tea cold. People thought
that he was crazy as no one served chilled tea at that time.</p>
<p>However, it was very well-received by the youths and was almost revolutionary.
This chilled tea turned out to be so popular, it became known as “bubble
tea” due to the thick layer of foam that forms at the top of the drink
after it is shaken.</p>
<p>The addition of tapioca pearls happened when a competition was held among
staff to create an innovative drink. The store manager, Ms Lin Hsiu-hui,
enjoyed eating a Taiwanese dessert called tapioca balls, or 粉圆 <em>fěn yuán</em> and
decided to add them to her iced Assam milk tea during a staff meeting.</p>
<p>And bam! Just like that, the bubble tea that we now know was born! It
was so well-liked that other teahouses in Taiwan started following the
trend, and it continued to spread from there, bringing joy to all over
the world!</p>

<p>Daily dose of joy sounds like a dream, doesn’t it? A cup a day keeps those
worries away. I’d hate to burst your bubble, but did you know: other than
joy, too much bubble tea could also lead to diabetes? A classic 500ml bubble
milk tea has about 102.5g of sugar (excluding the sugar present in the
bubbles), which is about 2.3 times more sugar than in 500ml of coke.</p>

<p>But not to worry, you can still enjoy your weekly dose of bubble tea with
some minor adjustments:</p>
<p>1. Request for less sugar (30% or lower)</p>
<p>2. Opt for plain tea without milk (or fresh, low-fat or skimmed milk instead
of non-dairy creamer)</p>
<p>3. Substitute tapioca pearls for white pearls instead</p>
<p>Remember, the key is moderation. Keep calm and boba on (in moderation)!</p>
