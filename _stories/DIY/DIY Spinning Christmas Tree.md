<h4><strong>The Origins and Symbolism of the Christmas Tree</strong></h4>

<p>Curious about where the iconic Christmas tree actually came from? Long
ago, people decorated evergreens during the winter solstice, treating them
as symbols of life in the year’s darkest stretch. In the 16th century,
Germans began adorning Christmas trees, and <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/luther_martin.shtml" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Martin Luther</a> ,
a German Theologian, was said to have added candles to reflect the glow
of the stars. The tradition spread across Europe and gained even more attention
in the 1800s when <a href="https://www.royal.uk/encyclopedia/victoria-r-1837-1901" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Queen Victoria</a> and
<a href="https://www.royal.uk/prince-albert" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Prince Albert</a>of the United Kingdom embraced it. German immigrants
later carried the custom to America, where it steadily grew in popularity.
By the late 19th century, Christmas trees were found in homes everywhere,
gradually transforming with electric lights and ornaments. &nbsp;</p>
<p>A Christmas tree is a special symbol for celebrating Christmas, and it’s
not just for Christians — it’s for anyone who enjoys the holiday spirit!
The tree is usually decorated with lights, ornaments, and sometimes even
candy. For many, it’s a time to spend with family, share gifts, and feel
happy together. Today, it’s a symbol of joy, hope, and warmth. Whether
you celebrate Christmas or not, the tree brings people together in a fun,
festive way! It symbolizes joy, hope, and the spirit of the holiday season.</p>
<h4><strong>What Makes the Tree Spin?</strong></h4>

</p>
<p>Now let’s get back to making your very own Spinning Christmas Tree. How
does it spin? That’s thanks to a <strong>homopolar motor</strong>! It’s
one of the simplest motors you can make, using just a battery, a magnet,
and a piece of copper wire. When you connect the wire so electricity flows
from the battery and touches the magnet, the wire starts to spin. This
happens because moving electricity creates a magnetic field, and the magnet
pushes against it. This push is called the <a href="https://byjus.com/physics/lorentz-force/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Lorentz Force</a>, and
it’s what makes the wire move. Since the battery sends power in only one
direction, the wire always spins the same way. It’s a cool and fun way
to see how electricity and magnetism can work together to create motion!
(Watch how the homopolar motor spins <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p29gy0OBaY8&amp;t=4s" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>!)</p>

</p>
<p>So, what is a <strong>magnetic field</strong>? A <strong>magnetic field</strong> is
an invisible force around a magnet that can pull or push certain objects,
like iron or steel. If you’ve ever played with magnets and felt them stick
together or push away from each other, that’s the magnetic field at work.
Even electricity can make a magnetic field when it flows through wires.
Earth has one too, which is why compasses always point north. Magnetic
fields are all around us, helping things like compasses, motors, and even
trains work. Pretty cool, right? (Click <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/articles/z8g996f#zr8xxbk" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> to

<h4><strong>The Need for Sustainability and Conservation</strong></h4>

<p>Batteries and wires can become electronic waste when we throw them away.
Batteries have <a href="https://internationalfireandsafetyjournal.com/the-environmental-impact-of-battery-disposal/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">chemicals</a> inside
that can hurt the Earth if they leak into the ground or water. Wires are
often made of metals or plastic, which are non-biodegradable and do not
break down easily. If we toss them in the trash, they just sit in <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/semakau-landfill-filling-waste-management-incineration-reduce-reuse-recycle-3909436" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">landfills</a> and
pollute the planet.</p>

<p>The good news is, we can recycle them! Recycling helps reuse the metal
and keeps the dangerous stuff out of nature. So instead of throwing batteries
and wires away, we should take them to special places that recycle electronics
safely. The National Environment Agency (NEA) of Singapore has set up electronic
waste bins in many areas accessible to people. ALBA E-Waste has also deployed
more than 870 collection points, dedicated to collect a wide variety of
e-Waste from batteries to consumer computers. (You can find out where to
drop off your E-waste items at the bins provided by NEA <a href="https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/waste-management/3r-programmes-and-resources/e-waste-management/where-to-recycle-e-waste" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> and
by ALBA E-waste <a href="https://alba-ewaste.sg/drop-off-locations/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here.</a>)</p>
<p>Of course, making this DIY Spinning Christmas Tree is a perfect way to
upcycle! This simple DIY project demonstrates basic electromagnetic principles
in a fun and decorative way, perfect for holiday science displays or teaching
kids how electric motors work with everyday household items.</p>
