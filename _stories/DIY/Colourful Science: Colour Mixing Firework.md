<h4><strong>The Story Behind Singapore’s National Day</strong></h4>
<p>National Day is a vibrant cultural street parade featuring dazzling floats
and performances, celebrating our nation's heritage and multiculturalism.
It’s this unity, despite our differences, that drives us forward, fostering
a sense of belonging among all Singaporeans. It’s a moment to reflect on
the resilience and determination that have shaped Singapore into the powerhouse
it is today.</p>

<p>As evening falls, Singapore's skyline comes alive with dazzling light
displays. The National Day light-up is an unforgettable sight, with the
iconic Marina Bay Sands and Merlion illuminated in red and white, reflecting
the pride and joy of our nation. The streets are filled with cheerful crowds

</p>
<p>And of course, no National Day celebration is complete without the iconic
fireworks display. As the night sky is illuminated with vibrant bursts
of colour, the dazzling fireworks symbolize the joy and pride that fills
the hearts of all Singaporeans.</p>
<h4><strong>Want to know how fireworks work?</strong> </h4>
<p>Fireworks are made with science! When the firework shoots up into the
sky, it's because of a special powder inside that creates a big push. The
bright colours in fireworks come from special metals and chemicals. Scientists
learnt how to mix them to make all the beautiful colours we see in the
sky! The beautiful colours you see come from different metals burning up
- just like how your gas stove has blue flames. Some metals burn red, others
burn green or blue. That's why we get such pretty colours lighting up the
sky during National Day! (Find out more in detail how fireworks work

<p>As we celebrate National Day 2025, let’s take pride in how far we’ve come,
honour the diversity that makes us strong, and look forward to a bright
future. Together, we are Singapore!
