<h4>What do you get when you mix a tissue box, a couple of plastic cups, and a sprinkle of creativity? A surprisingly loud homemade speaker‚Äîand a great reason to learn about sound and upcycling with your child! Let‚Äôs repurpose, play and learn with a DIY Speaker!</h4>

<p>At first glance, that empty tissue box might be destined for the bin.
But with a little imagination, it becomes the heart of a science-powered
project that brings together hands-on play and a deeper understanding of
sound.</p>
<p>We tried building a DIY acoustic speaker using <strong>repurposed household items</strong>.
It‚Äôs perfect for kids aged 4 and up, with a little help from a parent or
older sibling, and teaches basic science concepts while keeping waste out
of the landfill. A win-win!</p>

<h4><strong>Why Upcycling is Awesome</strong></h4>
<p>We often hear about ‚ÄúReduce, Reuse, Recycle‚Äù, but what about <strong>Upcycle</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>Upcycling</strong> means turning something old or unwanted into
something useful, creative, or fun, just like our DIY speaker! It‚Äôs not
just good for the planet, it‚Äôs great for curious minds too!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some examples of items or trash being repurposed!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs why:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>üóëÔ∏è <strong>Less waste</strong>: We keep materials out of the trash and
reduce pollution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üí° <strong>More creativity</strong>: Kids learn that they don‚Äôt need new
toys to have fun‚Äîthey can make their own!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üå± <strong>Caring for the Earth</strong>: It starts conversations about
making thoughtful choices and protecting our environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üí∞ <strong>Budget-friendly fun</strong>: No fancy materials needed‚Äîjust
things lying around the house!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Upcycling is not just about reducing waste, it is about unlocking new
possibilities. Across Singapore, even food packaging is getting a second
life, thanks to creative initiatives that turn used materials into useful
items like coasters and containers. (Curious to see how Singapore‚Äôs food
packaging waste is being upcycled into something new?

<p>However, it does not stop there. Upcycling is also happening in our schools
where kindness, creativity and sustainability meet. Children are transforming
trash into toys, learning empathy along the way and entire school communities
are giving new purpose to old belongings. Through creative storytelling,
children learn more about kindness through the upcycling activities done
with their friends. (Click this <a href="https://ourlearningjourney.sg/index.php/2022/12/16/turning-trash-into-toys-upcycling-for-kindness/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">link</a> to
read more on how children learn all about being kind while transforming
trash into toys.)</p>
<p>In another inspiring example, Changkat Primary School upcycled 2000 old
uniforms into thoughtful keepsakes to celebrate its 60th anniversary. With
help from parents, pupils and volunteers, the project tackled the issue
that 86% of school uniforms end up as waste. One example includes uniforms
being repurposed as paint brush holders, auctioned to benefit the school‚Äôs
parents‚Äô support group. (<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/parenting-education/changkat-primary-school-turns-2000-old-uniforms-into-new-creations-for-60th-anniversary" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Read more</a> about

</p>
<p>From upcycled school uniforms to DIY speakers, these creative efforts
show that science and sustainability can go hand in hand and start right
at home. Upcycling does not just reduce waste, it encourages curiosity,
problem-solving and care for the world around us. Whether it is turning
cardboard into toys or giving old clothes a new purpose, everyday materials
hold the potential for extraordinary learning.&nbsp;</p>
