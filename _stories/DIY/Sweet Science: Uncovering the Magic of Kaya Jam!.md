<p><strong>Kaya Jam</strong>
</p>
<p>Toasted bread spread evenly with rich, creamy kaya jam reminds us of our
local Singaporean dish. Coconut jam also known as kaya jam is made from
coconut cream, eggs, sugar, and sometimes pandan leaves for additional
flavouring. Kaya jam is a sweet and creamy spread that can be found in
almost every neighbourhood coffee shop.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Origins of Kaya Jam</strong>
</p>
<p>When Hainanese immigrants came to Singapore in the 19th century, many
of them worked as cooks for the British people. As most of the British
people left Singapore in the 20th century, the&nbsp;Hainanese immigrants
started their own businesses by selling food at the local coffee shops,
also known as kopitiams. They adapted the original English-style fruit
based jams used in breakfast and created kaya jam. Hainanese cooks and
kopitiam were responsible for popularising the consumption and taste of
Kaya that most Singaporeans know today.&nbsp;(Find out more about the

<p><strong>The Science of Kaya Jam</strong>
</p>
<p>So what gives kaya its thick consistency? When the kaya jam mixture is
heated on the stove, the heat causes the proteins in the eggs to thicken.
Just like how we fry eggs in the pan, the heat from the fire causes the
egg to solidify. This is known as coagulation, which gives kaya its creamy
and spreadable texture</p>
<p>For our little friends, think of the egg yolk and egg whites as a big
group of tiny building blocks all stuck together. When we warm it up, those
blocks start to shake and wiggle because they’re getting hot. Some of them
even break apart and start to stick to each other in new ways, creating
a thick, yummy mixture.</p>
<p><strong>Here are some discussion topics for parents and educators to have with your little ones when you’re making your very own kaya jam.</strong>
