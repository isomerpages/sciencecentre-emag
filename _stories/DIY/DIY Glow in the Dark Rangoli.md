<h4>The Festival of Lights</h4>
<p>Every year, streets and homes across the world come alive with a warm
golden glow as people celebrate Deepavali — also known as the Festival
of Lights. The name comes from Sanskrit and means “Row of Lights.”</p>
<p>For thousands of years, Hindu families have celebrated this festival as
a reminder that good will always triumph over evil, and light will always
overcome darkness. One of the most well-loved stories behind the festival
tells of Lord Krishna’s victory over the demon king Narakasura — a symbol
of truth and goodness prevailing.</p>
<p>To honour this triumph, families light up rows of small oil lamps called
diyas. The gentle flicker of each flame represents hope, warmth, and new
beginnings. Beyond its religious roots, Deepavali is also a time for reflection,
renewal, and gratitude — a celebration of light that shines brightest in
times of darkness.</p>

</p>
<p>In Singapore, Deepavali is celebrated with much enthusiasm and colour,
especially in areas like Little India, which comes alive with bright street
decorations, festive bazaars, and traditional music. Families mark the
occasion by visiting relatives and friends, offering prayers, exchanging
gifts, feasting on delicious Indian sweets, and wearing new clothes to
symbolise a fresh start.</p>
<p>Homes are cleaned and decorated in preparation for the festival, and rows
of diyas are placed at doorways and windows to invite the goddess Lakshmi,
who represents wealth and prosperity. The warm glow of these lights is
believed to bless households with good fortune for the year ahead. Many
families also enjoy setting off sparklers and fireworks, adding to the
lively, celebratory atmosphere.</p>
<p>Another cherished custom is creating rangoli — intricate, colourful floor
art made near the entrance of homes. Crafted using coloured powder, rice,
sand, or flower petals, rangoli is believed to invite positive energy into
the home while keeping negativity away. Each design is unique, representing
joy, harmony, and prosperity.</p>
<h4>The Significance of Rangoli</h4>

</p>
<p>Rangoli is one of the most recognisable and meaningful symbols of Deepavali.
This traditional art form dates back to ancient India, where it was believed
that creating beautiful patterns on the ground would please the gods and
bring blessings to the household. Over time, it has become both a cultural
and artistic expression passed down through generations.</p>
<p>Each element in a rangoli carries symbolic meaning:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Geometric shapes&nbsp;symbolise balance and harmony.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flowers&nbsp;reflect beauty and joy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Peacocks&nbsp;represent grace and prosperity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some even feature the footprints of the goddess Lakshmi to mark her arrival!
The materials used to create rangoli, such as rice flour or natural dyes,
are chosen with care and intention, highlighting the importance of mindfulness
in the process.</p>

</p>
<p>In many homes, small diyas are placed at the centre of the rangoli during
puja (Hindu prayer rituals), creating a soft glow that enhances its beauty.
Today, rangoli continues to evolve, from traditional designs to modern
interpretations, but its essence remains the same: a heartfelt expression
of joy, creativity, and devotion.</p>

<h4>Make Your Own Glow-in-the-Dark Rangoli 🌟</h4>
<p>Even if you don’t celebrate Deepavali, you can still join in the festive
fun by making your own DIY rangoli at home — with a modern twist. Instead
of oil lamps, your rangoli will light up with glow-in-the-dark paint!</p>
<p>Glow-in-the-dark paint contains special substances called phosphors that
take in light energy and slowly release it afterwards. After your design
“charges up” under a light source, it will shine beautifully when the lights
go off.</p>
<p>To start making your own glow-in-the-dark rangoli, refer to the activity
