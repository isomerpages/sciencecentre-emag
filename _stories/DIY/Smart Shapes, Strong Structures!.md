<p>Have you ever looked up at the Marina Bay Sands and wondered how that
big boat stays on top? Or seen towering skyscrapers and thought, “How do
they not fall over?”</p>

<p>Maybe you’ve looked around your neighbourhood, at the tall HDB blocks
and asked yourself, “How can they hold so many people and all of their
things?”</p>

<p>If these thoughts have crossed your mind, then you’re already thinking
like a structural engineer!</p>
<p><strong>What Is Structural Engineering?</strong>
<br><strong><br></strong>Structural engineering is all about making things
like our homes, schools, and even places like playgrounds, strong and safe!</p>
<p>Structural engineers design these structures with a lot of thought and
consideration for a bunch of different requirements. These include factors
like the weather, the shape of the buildings, and choosing the right materials
so that whatever is constructed can last for a very long time.</p>
<p>Some structural engineers help design big, fancy places like Marina Bay
Sands. But many of them work on everyday things we can see around us, right
in our own neighborhoods. They help to build the MRT lines that stay strong
even with heavy trains travelling on them all day, HDBs that hold up several
floors of residents, and even the humble walkways that shelter us from
the elements.</p>
<p>Let’s take a closer look!</p>

<p><strong>Terrific Tracks</strong>
</p>
<p>In places where the MRT tracks are above ground, they are held up by things
called viaducts. A viaduct is a special type of bridge that can carry MRT
tracks over long distances, even across the urban areas or uneven terrain
of Singapore! This ensures that passengers have a smooth and continuous
ride.</p>
<p>These viaducts are made out of durable materials like reinforced concrete
and are supported by strong evenly-spaced columns. These are all measures
that structural engineers put in place to make sure the viaducts distribute
weight equally and can support heavy trains every single day!</p>

<p><strong>Wonderful Walkways</strong>
</p>
<p>Looking around your neighbourhood, you might miss some everyday conveniences
that we always seem to take for granted. Take sheltered walkways, for example.
You might not spare them a second glance, at least until it starts raining!</p>
<p>Though these walkways may seem quite simple and mundane, a lot of thought
goes into building them. They are made from strong materials like steel
and special roofing that don’t need to be cleaned or repaired often. Structural
engineers carefully plan their shape, size, and slope to make sure they
remain well-maintained and the walkways stay safe and comfy for everyone!</p>
<p>(Learn more about the <a href="https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/Commercial/Covered-Walkways" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>walkways</u></a> around
your neighbourhood and find out how our walkways <a href="https://www.mnd.gov.sg/newsroom/parliament-matters/q-as/view/written-answer-by-ministry-of-national-development-on-designs-of-sheltered-walkways" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>shelter us</u></a> from

</p>
<p>To summarise, structural engineering is all around us. You just need to
know where to look! Whether it’s iconic landmarks around Singapore or the
familiar sights around our neighbourhoods, structural engineers use strong
shapes and materials to make sure everything stays safe and secure.</p>
<p>We’ve learnt that structural engineers put a lot of careful planning into
their work, like making sure to use certain shapes to spread weight evenly
and keep buildings standing strong for a very long time. They also rely
on materials which can handle heavy loads and harsh weather.</p>
<p>But remember, building a strong building doesn’t always mean using the
toughest and sturdiest materials; strength also comes from smart design!
So the next time you walk by any interesting-looking structures, think
about the shapes that make them strong!</p>
<p>Who knows? One day, you might be Singapore’s next top structural engineer!</p>
<p><strong>Paper Tower Shapes</strong>
</p>
<p>But you don’t have to be a structural engineer to learn more about structural
engineering! In fact, you can do so at home with a few sheets of paper
and some books!</p>
