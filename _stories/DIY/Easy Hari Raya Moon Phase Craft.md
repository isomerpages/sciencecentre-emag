<p>Hari Raya Aidilfitri, also known simply as Eid Al-Fitr (Eid), is one of
the most anticipated celebrations in Singapore, marking the end of the
holy month of Ramadan. For the Muslim community, it's a time of joy, gratitude,
and family gatherings, a day to celebrate the successful completion of
a month of fasting, self-reflection, and spiritual growth.</p>

<p>In Singapore, the festive spirit is in full swing, with the streets of
Kampong Glam and Geylang Serai transforming into a vibrant spectacle. The
air is filled with the aroma of traditional Malay delicacies like ketupat,
rendang, and kuih-muih, while homes are adorned with colourful lights and
intricate decorations. However, the timing of this much-loved celebration
is deeply tied to the moon.</p>
<h4><strong>The Role of the Moon in Determining Eid Al-Fitr</strong></h4>
<p>Unlike the Gregorian calendar, which is fixed and predictable, the Islamic
calendar follows the lunar cycle. This means that the dates of Islamic
holidays like Eid are determined by the sighting of the new moon, which
marks the end of the month of Ramadan and the beginning of the next month,
Syawal. (<a href="https://governmentscienceandengineering.blog.gov.uk/2024/04/10/the-moon-and-the-celebration-of-eid-al-fitr/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Find out more about the Moon and the celebration of Eid here!</a>)&nbsp;</p>

</p>
<p>In Singapore, the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (MUIS) plays
a vital role in observing the moon's phases to announce the official date
for Hari Raya Aidilfitri. The new moon must be sighted with the naked eye,
marking the end of Ramadan and the start of Syawal. This can sometimes
lead to uncertainty, as moon sighting is not always the same on every country.
As a result, Eid might be celebrated on different days depending on local
sightings. (See the <a href="https://www.muis.gov.sg/resources/media-releases/9-apr-24-syawal-announcement_eng" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">official Eid 2024 announcement by MUIS</a> here).</p>

<p>In today's Singapore, with its melting pot of cultures and religions,
the celebration of Hari Raya Aidilfitri has evolved to reflect the multicultural

prayers and festive meals but also to share the joy with neighbours and
friends from all walks of life. The celebration fosters a sense of unity,
respect, and understanding among the diverse communities in Singapore.
Whether it's the twinkling lights of the Hari Raya bazaar or the family
