<h4><strong>The Symbolism of Chinese New Year</strong></h4>

<p>In China,<a href="https://www.chinahighlights.com/travelguide/festivals/chinese-new-year-spring-festival.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"> S<u>pring Festival</u></a> is
the common name for Chinese Lunar New Year. This festival does in fact
take place during the time that the northern hemisphere starts its gradual
warming, having already passed the coldest part of the winter.</p>
<p>During this season, flowers such as orchids, peach blossoms, cherry blossoms,
and citrus trees<a href="http://english.scio.gov.cn/m/in-depth/2025-04/21/content_117835022.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"> <u>bloom</u></a> during
the Spring Festival. These flowers symbolize new beginnings and good luck
while the use of the colour red in clothes and decorations represents happiness
and prosperity.

<h4><strong>The Science of Blooming Flowers</strong></h4>
<p>In nature,<a href="https://scienceforeverybody.com/blossoms-and-blooms-the-science-behind-spring-flowers/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"> <u>flowers bloom as the spring season</u></a> brings
warmer temperatures, longer days, and more sunlight, which triggers plant
growth. Plants use<a href="https://kids.britannica.com/kids/article/photosynthesis/353624" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"> <u>photo synthesis</u></a> to
turn sunlight into energy to make their own food. As the days get longer,
plants can obtain more sunlight, which helps them to grow faster and stronger.
Widely open spring flowers also attract<a href="https://www.insectlore.com/blogs/pollination/pollination-for-kids?srsltid=AfmBOopgLhB-x1DQme0eHr9eCEN5OyCD9isU2eZ3N-cEQ8m4vuMj8VXG" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"> <u>pollinators</u></a> like
bees and butterflies to help spread their pollen, which is needed to make
seeds and fruits for reproduction.</p>

<h4><strong>The Need for Sustainability</strong></h4>
<p>Another important part of Chinese New Year is the gifting of the hongbao
or<a href="https://www.chinahighlights.com/travelguide/festivals/red-envelop.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"> <u>red envelope</u></a>.
A hongbao is a gift of money inserted into an ornate red pocket of paper
that may come in various designs. They are also given on other important
occasions, such as birthdays and weddings, as a way to send good wishes.</p>
<p>Writing auspicious wishes and<a href="https://party.alibaba.com/newyear/why-do-we-say-blessings-in-lunar-new-year" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"> <u>blessings</u></a> during
Chinese New Year is also a common practice. It is a deeply rooted tradition
that expresses hopes for prosperity, health, family harmony, and good fortune
in the coming year.</p>
<p>Some commonly used phrases are:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>恭喜发财 (gōngxǐ fācái) - wishing you happiness and prosperity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>身体健康 (shēntǐ jiànkāng) - wishing you good health</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>万事如意 (wànshì rúyì) - hope everything goes well</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>年年有余 (niánnián yǒuyú) - may you have abundance every year</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>大吉大利 (dàjí dàlì) - lots of luck and profits</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>心想事成 (xīnxiǎng shìchéng) - may all your wishes come true</p>

<p><a href="https://redpacket.hk/cultural-taboos-to-avoid-when-giving-red-packets/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Reusing hongbaos is generally avoided due to a combination of cultural beliefs and practical considerations related to etiquette.</u></a> As
hongbaos are seen as a way to pass on luck and good wishes to the recipient
for the coming year, givers are expected to use brand-new ones to symbolize
a fresh start and sincerity. Also, many hongbaos feature the specific zodiac
animal of the current year or bear greetings for specific events, making
them inappropriate for use in a subsequent year or different occasion.
Used hongbaos often show signs of wear and tear, and giving them out can
be perceived as impolite or a lack of respect for the recipient.</p>

</p>
<p>Hongbaos often feature heavy dyes, gold stamping, foil, glitter, and plastic
coatings, which are considered contaminants in the standard paper recycling
process. These materials can mess up the pulping process at paper mills
and require specialized machinery to handle. Hence, it is<a href="https://mothership.sg/2022/03/paper-recycling-red-packets/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"> <u>challenging to recycle</u></a> them
as well.</p>
<p>An alternative way of reducing the wastage of these hongbaos is to use
them in<a href="https://www.pinterest.com/leeml_meiling/red-packet-crafts/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"> <u>crafts</u></a>!
A simple craft that you can make at home with these leftover hongbaos are
your very own blooming ‘flowers’. Just follow the simple steps below and
find out why these craft flowers are able to 'bloom' on their own!</p>
