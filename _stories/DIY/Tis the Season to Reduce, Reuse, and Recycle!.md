<p>Christmas is a magical time of year filled with fun, family, food, and,
of course, gifts! However, during the holiday season, it’s easy to create
a lot of waste from wrapping paper to decorations to leftover food.</p>
<h4><strong>Wastage During Festive Seasons</strong></h4>
<p>Did you know in 2023, the total amount of waste disposed of in Singapore
amounted to 1.67 million metric tonnes? That’s the same as 334,000 elephants
marching through the city! (<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/628000/waste-disposed-in-singapore/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Statistics of waste in Singapore</a>)</p>

</p>
<p>But with a little creativity, we can make Christmas fun and festive while
also being eco-friendly. One easy way to achieve this is by practicing
the three Rs:<strong><em> Reuse, Reduce, and Recycle.</em></strong> Let's
dive into how you can bring the spirit of Christmas to life while also
protecting the Earth!</p>
<h4><strong>What are the three Rs?</strong></h4>
<p>The three Rs (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) are simple actions that help play
an important role in preventing waste generation and bringing about a multitude
of benefits such as conserving natural resources and reducing pollution.
(Find out more about the three Rs <a href="https://www.gov.sg/article/Reduce-Reuse-Recycle-Simple-Steps-for-a-Sustainable-Future" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>!)</p>
<p>1. <strong><em>Reduce </em></strong>means to use things carefully to reduce
the amount of waste created by consuming less resources. For example, cutting
back the amount of wrapping paper you use.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Reducing </em>the items that we buy and use helps to save raw materials
(like trees and metals) that are used to make other things. The less we
use, the less waste we create, and the less pollution we cause.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. <strong><em>Reuse </em></strong>means finding new ways to use things
again instead of throwing them away. For example, using the same gift bags
and ornaments instead of buying new ones.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Reusing </em>helps us to save energy and resources because we won’t
need to make new products. It’s like finding new ways to play with things
that you already have! The less we throw away, the less trash we create,
and the more room we have to enjoy nature.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. <strong><em>Recycle </em></strong>means turning something old into something
new. For example, using leftover wrapping paper to create your own decorations
this upcoming holiday season.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Recycling</em> helps turn trash into treasure! The many things that
we throw away like paper and plastic can be turned into brand new things.
The more we recycle, the more we keep these items out of the trash and
save natural resources.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Why does it matter?&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>Cutting back on waste and giving new life to old items is important and
Christmas is all about giving, but it’s also an important time for us to
reflect on how we can take care of the Earth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By practicing the 3 Rs (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle), we can help make this
holiday season a little greener!</p>
<h4><strong>Make your own DIY Christmas decorations</strong></h4>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/diyxmasex.png">
</div>
<p>Here are the materials you will need:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Old wrapping paper</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Empty toilet paper rolls</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bottle caps</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Twine</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Glue</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scissors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Markers optional</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Glitter (optional)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Step 1: Choose Your Base Materials</strong>
</p>
<p>Start by choosing a material you would like to reuse as the base for your
decoration. Here are a few ideas:</p>
<p>Toilet paper rolls: These can be turned into mini stars, flowers, or fun
shapes.</p>
<p>Bottle caps: These are great for creating snowmen, or ornaments.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Step 2: Cutting and Shaping</strong>
</p>
<p>Toilet paper roll wreaths: Take one or more toilet paper rolls, cut them
into smaller rings, and glue them together to make a wreath or a flower.</p>
<p>Bottle cap ornaments: If you’re using bottle caps, glue them together
to form shapes like a snowman or a simple ornament.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>

<p><strong>Step 3: Decorating</strong>
</p>
<p>Now the fun part begins, Decorating!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use:</p>
<p>. Old wrapping paper to cover your creations or cut into smaller pieces
to create patterns.</p>
<p>. Colour or glitter your ornaments in festive colours like red, green,
gold, or silver.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

</div>
<p><strong>Step 4: Hang and Enjoy!</strong>
</p>
<p>Once your decorations are dry (if you used glue), you can hang them on
the Christmas tree, around the house, or even on the window for a festive
touch. Your creations will not only look beautiful but will also be a reminder
of how fun it is to reuse and recycle!</p>
