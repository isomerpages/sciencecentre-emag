<p>Robotic parts have many functions to help make life processes easier for
humans. They can allow control to happen remotely without the presence
of humans on site. Singapore’s researchers design and deploy robots for
various <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/tech/robots-assemble-meet-singapore-s-robotic-workforce" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>tasks</u></a> and
<a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/about-half-new-bto-projects-use-more-robots-painting-skimming-works-2025-4693626" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>projects</u>
</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A robotic hand is a mechanical device designed to emulate the function
and dexterity of a human hand. They are typically mounted on robotic arms
and use motors, actuators, sensors and control systems, to grip, move and
rotate objects.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Robotic hands play a role in the medical sector. They can function as
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68368439" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>prosthetics</u>
</a>, which are artificial devices that replaces a missing body part, which
may be lost through physical trauma, disease, or a condition present at
birth. They help people who have lost a hand do everyday things again,
like holding a cup or tying shoes.</p>

<p>Robotic hands also play a part in <a href="https://vention.io/blogs/robotic-arms-in-manufacturing-763?srsltid=AfmBOoon7GtK9cTsFr923Bxnbs-cluIGh_RP4U1DTDBbkBQtQC4Z6HIq" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>automated assembly and manufacturing industries</u></a>.
They are like super helpers that can grab, move, and put together parts
to build things like cars, phones, or toys. These robot hands use sensors,
motors, and computers to know exactly what to do. They can screw in bolts,
place tiny pieces, or move heavy stuff quickly and safely. People programme
them to do the same job over and over, quickly and without mistakes. This
helps factories make lots of products in less time. Robot hands are great
teammates for humans, making work easier and more efficient!</p>

<p>Robotic hands serve recreational purposes as well such as the arms of
the claw machine. Imagine having them help you get your favourite Labubu

<h4><strong>The Need for Sustainability and Conservation</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<p>Beyond their use in industries and everyday convenience, robotic hands
can also play a crucial role in addressing global sustainability challenges.
With their precision and ability to handle delicate tasks, they can be
integrated into smart waste management systems to identify, sort, and process
recyclable materials more efficiently. This helps reduce the environmental
footprint of human consumption and supports efforts to minimize landfill
waste. One key area where robotic technology could make a difference is
in the management of plastic waste, especially the widespread use of disposable
straws, which remains a pressing issue.
<br>
</p>
<p>Straws are used in large amounts every day across the world. Although
some restaurants have phased out their use, many beverage chains (e.g.
bubble tea shops) continue to rely heavily on them. Robotic hands could
potentially be used to support the collection and sorting of plastic straws
for recycling or upcycling, giving these items a second life instead of
letting them pollute our environment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It is estimated that 8.3 billion plastic straws pollute the world's beaches
and they are 7<sup>th</sup> out of the top 10 plastic items found in ocean
cleanups. On average, plastic straws take around 200 years to decompose.
In total, straw waste adds up to 73,000 metric tons per year, which is
about the weight of 540 Boeing 777 planes. (More statistics on straw pollution
can be found <a href="https://www.shop-without-plastic.com/blogs/how-much-do-contribute-to-pollution/how-much-do-plastic-straws-contribute-to-pollution?srsltid=AfmBOopCFR-tl14eebTq10rSa_ZRHK_ES9qdzex9TZScoVVztTGvHrFQ" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>.)</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

</p>
<p></p>
<p>If they are not discarded properly, they eventually end up in oceans where
marine animals mistake them as food, leading to suffocation and death.
<a href="https://www.plasticpollutioncoalition.org/blog/2017/4/28/are-drinking-straws-dangerous" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Stomachs of penguins and nostrils of sea turtles have been found perforated by plastic straws</u>
</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In parallel, the rise of e-commerce has led to increased cardboard usage,
as products are packaged for shipping and delivery. In Singapore alone,
<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/business/e-commerce-sales-in-spore-expected-to-reach-196b-by-2027-despite-slower-growth-this-year" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>e-commerce sales are projected to reach $19.6 billion by 2027</u>
</a>. With this growth comes a surge in cardboard waste, much of which ends
up discarded after a single use.</p>

</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is where upcycling, combined with the precision and assistance of
robotic hands, can offer new possibilities. Upcycling involves creatively
transforming waste materials into new, higher-value products with practical
uses. Imagine robotic hands sorting and preparing materials like plastic
straws and cardboard, assisting makers and crafters in turning trash into
treasures. Straws can be used to create decorative lights, mini-Christmas
trees, or earrings while cardboard can be reimagined into toys, organizers,
or DIY furniture. With a bit of creativity, and perhaps a little robotic
help, household waste can be transformed into something beautiful and useful,
supporting both innovation and sustainability. Here are <a href="https://www.boredart.com/2019/08/repurposing-plastic-straw-crafts-ideas.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>40 ways to repurpose plastic straws</u></a>!

<h4><strong>Building a simple robotic hand</strong></h4>
<p>Become a robotic engineer in this holiday activity! Transform cardboard
rolls, drinking straws, and air-dry clay into a robotic hand.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Through hands-on design, you will learn about the basic mechanics of robotics,
such as joints, levers, and control systems. As you build, you will enhance
your problem-solving skills and explore engineering concepts in a playful
way. At the same time, you will understand the value of upcycling these
materials into a useful product to perform tasks in our daily life.</p>
