<h4>Robotic hands are doing it all—assembling gadgets, helping people, and even turning trash into treasure! Find out how these handy helpers are making life cooler, greener, and more fun.</h4>
<p>Robotic parts have many functions to help make life processes easier for
humans. They can allow control to happen remotely without the presence
of humans on site. Singapore’s researchers design and deploy robots for
various <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/tech/robots-assemble-meet-singapore-s-robotic-workforce" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>tasks</u></a> and

</a>.</p>

<p>A robotic hand is a mechanical device designed to emulate the function
and dexterity of a human hand. They are typically mounted on robotic arms
and use motors, actuators, sensors and control systems, to grip, move and
rotate objects.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Robotic hands play a role in the medical sector. They can function as
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68368439" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>prosthetics</u>
</a>, which are artificial devices that replaces a missing body part, which
may be lost through physical trauma, disease, or a condition present at
birth. They help people who have lost a hand do everyday things again,
like holding a cup or tying shoes.</p>

<p>Robotic hands also play a part in <a href="https://vention.io/blogs/robotic-arms-in-manufacturing-763?srsltid=AfmBOoon7GtK9cTsFr923Bxnbs-cluIGh_RP4U1DTDBbkBQtQC4Z6HIq" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>automated assembly and manufacturing industries</u></a>.
They are like super helpers that can grab, move, and put together parts
to build things like cars, phones, or toys. These robot hands use sensors,
motors, and computers to know exactly what to do. They can screw in bolts,
place tiny pieces, or move heavy stuff quickly and safely. People programme
them to do the same job over and over, quickly and without mistakes. This
helps factories make lots of products in less time. Robot hands are great
teammates for humans, making work easier and more efficient!</p>
