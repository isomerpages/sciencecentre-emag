<h4><strong>Episode 2: Could Durian Be the Secret to a Sustainable Future? with Prof. William Chen</strong></h4>
<p>Durian is a beloved staple in Singapore, with over <a href="https://www.asiaone.com/singapore/singapore-scientists-turn-discarded-durian-husks-antibacterial-bandages" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">12 million consumed annually</a>.
But what happens to the durian seeds and husks after it is consumed? As
the nation strives for sustainability and a circular economy, how can we
better manage the food waste we generate? Using the King of Fruits as an
example, food technologist Prof. William Chen shows us how we can transform
trash into treasure, from durian-derived antibacterial bandages, biodegradable
food wraps, and natural food stabilisers.</p>

<p><strong>JANICE:</strong> This is Void Deck, a podcast from Science Centre
Singapore where we sit down with local STEM changemakers and explore science
happening right here in Singapore. I'm your host, Janice. Today, we're
asking: could durian be the secret to a sustainable future? Scientists
in Singapore have transformed the leftover seeds and skins of the iconic
King of Fruits into antibacterial bandages, biodegradable food wraps and
natural food stabilisers, and here to tell us more is food technologist
Prof. William Chen. Prof. Chen is the Michael Fam Endowed Professor and
Director of the Food Science &amp; Technology Programme at Nanyang Technological
University.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>[Upbeat intro music]</em>
</p>
<p><strong>JANICE: </strong>Thank you so much for coming on to the show.</p>
<p><strong>PROF. CHEN: </strong>Thank you for having me here.</p>
<p><strong>JANICE:</strong> How did you first become interested in durian?</p>
<p><strong>PROF. CHEN:</strong> Well, as our focus [at NTU Food Science &amp;
Technology Programme] is on reducing food waste, we have developed a number
of platform technologies, and one of them is actually to convert the solid
residues rich in fibre into biodegradable packaging materials. These include
the soybean residue (okara, in other terms) and the barley spent grain.</p>
<p>All these side-streams from the food processing industry are rich in cellulose.
So we have developed technology to convert these fibre-rich side-streams
into packaging materials. And since I mentioned this is a platform technology,
so we also apply to other fibre-rich side-streams, and durian husk is one
of those.</p>
<p><strong>JANICE: </strong>Okay, so the reason why you got interested in
durian is because of [its] fibre-rich properties as a byproduct?</p>
<p><strong>PROF. CHEN:</strong> Yeah, well, when we design our innovations,
we do not do it on the random basis. So first we analyse the composition
of these materials, and then we design strategy to upcycle these side-streams.</p>
<p>In other words, people call them “waste-to-be”, but we see value in these
side-streams because they are either nutrient-rich or fibre-rich, and we
can talk about nutrient rich-side of the story later on, but even when
we talk about durian husk, they are very rich in fibre and pectin and some
other materials.</p>
<p>But our technology platforms can be easily applied to convert the fibre-rich
part of the durian husk into biodegradable packaging materials.</p>
<p><strong>JANICE:</strong> Awesome. Most people wouldn't think of durian
as the fruit that will be upcycled, you know, because of the way it looks,
it's very big, it’s very bulky, it's very spiky, and of course it has that
infamous strong smell.&nbsp;</p>

</p>
<p>So what made you realise its potential for food science innovations?</p>
<p><strong>PROF. CHEN:</strong> Well, in Singapore, as we know, we generate
about 700,000 tonnes of food waste every year. In other words, it's about
two bowls of food waste generated per person per day.</p>
<p><strong>JANICE: </strong>Wow.</p>
<p><strong>PROF. CHEN: </strong>And reducing food waste is actually one of
the very important aspects of creating an efficient food system. For example,
if we can tackle this homogeneous side-streams, we can also look into tackling
the heterogeneous household food waste, but for the durian part, we know
that when you open up the durian, there's only that much or that little
you can eat.</p>
<p><strong>JANICE:</strong>  <em>[Laughs]</em> Yes!</p>
<p><strong>PROF. CHEN: </strong>The rest, you just throw them away. So we
look at the two aspects of this side-stream from durian. One is the husk.
The other one is the seed. So for the husk, we have mentioned that we can
convert them into biodegradable packaging material and also the bandages,
and for the seeds we also have developed this food stabiliser, which really
provides a cost-effective way to enhance the current food system.</p>
<p><strong>JANICE:</strong> Let's delve a little deeper about the durian husk.
In basic terms for listeners who aren't scientists, how would you transform
the husk into a clean antibacterial bandage?</p>
<p><strong>PROF. CHEN: </strong>When we look at the cellulose, right, you
know, which is abundant in this husk, what we do is we first extract the
cellulose using very simple technology. We do not generate the secondary
organic waste.</p>
<p>Instead, we use this very simple solution to convert this cellulose into
a transparent, translucent type of material that can be used either in
packaging material or other applications. In the case of bandages, we actually
cross-link these materials so that it will become a different material.</p>
<p>We call it hydrogel, and from the hydrogel we actually add a little bit
[of] the antimicrobial component, and then the bandages will become antimicrobial
bandages derived from durian husk, but has a wide application in term of
healthcare, you know, for individuals who may have a skin problem, a typical
skin problem we call acne, right, or very dry skin.</p>
<p>If you apply the common bandage, it's not moist, so it doesn't really
help them, whereas our moist hydrogel antimicrobial bandages actually relieve
this sensation of itchiness and also provide[s] this protection against
bacterial infection.</p>

</p>
<p><em>[Short musical transition]</em>
</p>
<p><strong>JANICE: </strong>What are some things the public may be surprised
to know about the processes involved in your research, for example, your
day-to-day operations, or how food scraps are being sourced? Are there
any interesting thing[s] about this process?</p>
<p><strong>PROF. CHEN: </strong>Well, if we talk about platform technologies
or technology platforms, we can talk about this cellulose extraction into
packaging materials. Another technology platform we have developed is actually
fermentation. I see this really as an anchor to solve a number of problems
in food waste reduction.</p>
<p>One of them is actually spoilage of side-streams like soybean residue,
barley spent grain being derived from making beer or making Milo. These
side-streams tend to be very rich in nutrient[s], which make them turn
bad very fast.</p>
<p>So by applying fermentation using good microbe (good microbe meaning the
probiotic or other type of beneficial microbes) we actually stop the spoilage.
Because it's like our gut. People, when they are healthy, they tend to
be less prone to food poisoning because the good microbe[s] occupy all
the space.</p>
<p>In the same line of thinking, when we give this side-stream to the good
microbe, they took up all the space so that the contaminating microbe [have]
no space to settle down and turn this nutrient-rich side-stream bad. So
this is what we have discovered when we apply the simple technology [of]
fermentation.</p>
<p>Fermentation, as the general public knows, has been widely applied in
our daily life. We talk about kimchi. We talk about miso. All these are
good example of food product[s] derived from fermentation. Or natto, right.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So when we apply fermentation technology to [these] nutrient-rich side-streams,
we stop the spoilage. At the same time, the good microbe produce[s] micronutrients
to make this final product even more nutritious.</p>
<p>In term of nutrition profile, there are two categories of nutrient. One
is called macronutrients. The other one is micronutrients. Macronutrients
will include protein, lipid, carbohydrate, whereas micronutrients will
include vitamin, antioxidant, short chain fatty acid.</p>
<p>So fermentation, the microbe will produce this micronutrients, and reach
this fermented product. And so we have demonstrated that this fermented
soybean residue can actually loop back to the current food system. For
example, we have produced a plant-based mayonnaise which has been reported
by <em><a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/ntu-scientists-develop-plant-based-ingredient-to-replace-eggs-and-dairy-in-mayonnaise" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">The Straits Times</a></em> before
using this technology.</p>
<p>And when I talk about this fermentation as a platform technology, it's
not simply about soybean residue or barley spent grain. In fact, we apply
the fermentation technology to convert the prawn shells into packaging
materials.</p>
<p>And what happened to the so-called nutrient rich solution from this fermentation
of such prawn shells? Well, we reconnect [it] back to the urban farming,
which is very important for Singapore's sustainable food security, so this
will become fertiliser for the urban farm.</p>
<p><strong>JANICE:</strong> That’s good. So it's a very closed loop way of
doing it.</p>
<p><strong>PROF. CHEN:</strong> Correct, exactly. What we aim is always to
create efficient food system that allows the minimum level of generation
of food waste, while maximising some of the food waste that we cannot avoid.
For example, as long as we eat bean curd, as long as we drink soy milk,
we will have this soybean residue.</p>
<p><strong>JANICE:</strong> Okara.</p>
<p><strong>PROF. CHEN:</strong> Yeah. So as long as people keep on drinking
beer, [we’ll] always have a barley spent grain. So these type of side-streams
would be important for us to find ways to either convert them into useful
materials or connect back to the food system.</p>
<p>But in any case, we should not leave it as a waste because they are still
very rich in useful component[s]. So our technology allows us to create
this full circular economy, which is very important for Singapore, because
we import 90 percent of the food into the country.</p>
<p>And the food waste is the last thing we want to see in large amount, because
they pollute the environment, you waste [it], you increase the burden of
government for food import, and so on.</p>
<p><strong>JANICE:</strong> We are very grateful for you and your team's effort
and dedication to helping create this more sustainable food cycle for all
of us. With that, moving on to our next question, you've lived and work
around the world researching about food science and technology. Why is
Singapore an exciting place for this field?</p>
<p><strong>PROF. CHEN:</strong> Well, if we look at Singapore, it's a small
city state well-known for high efficiency, and it has been recognised as
a one of the bright spot[s] globally for innovations.</p>
<p>In the case of food science and technology, it's using food science and
technology to create this efficient food system. [Being] small make[s]
us nimble and get[s] things [moving] fast. But that's only one part of
the perspective.</p>
<p>The other part, more importantly, is the need to develop urban solution[s]
for our food security. When we talk about urban solutions, people may say,
oh, that's because you don't have enough farmland, but I see things differently,
because it was estimated that by 2050, 70 percent of the world population
will live in urban areas.</p>
<p>We look at Singapore [as] a hub for biomedical science, R&amp;D, for AI,
for engineering, for the pharmaceutical industry as well. All these existing
expertise can be [and] are being translated into the food space. There
are a lot of existing expertise in Singapore that can be translated with
the correct tweaking, you know, to suit the food. The requirement can be
translated into the food space so that we can move very fast.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So therefore we are always well recognised globally. As you mentioned,
I work quite a fair bit with international organisations. We have been
invited by institutions like the World Health Organisation (WHO) [and]
Food and Agriculture Organisations (FAO) of the United Nations to work
on policy matters. And also, innovations developed in Singapore, through
working with these international institutions, we can achieve faster and
broader adoption because [this is] truly standardisation, harmonisation
with WHO and FAO.</p>
<p>I think we can see that the technology made in Singapore will have a wider
adoption and create real impact, not just for Singapore, but also beyond.</p>
