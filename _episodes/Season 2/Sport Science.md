<h4><strong>Guest Biography</strong></h4>
<p>Dr. Marcus Lee is Director of Special Projects at the National Youth Council
and also serves as Director and Principal Sport Biomechanist at the High
Performance Sport Institute, Sport Singapore. A former Head of Sport Science
and Medicine, Marcus has led teams behind the scenes to support Team Singapore
athletes across various sports at major competitions like the Olympics,
Asian Games and World Championships—making sure they’re not just ready
to compete, but ready to thrive.</p>
<p>Drawing from biomechanics, physiology, nutrition, psychology and medicine,
he and his team work closely with coaches and athletes to improve performance,
reduce injury risks, and fine-tune every detail—from strength and movement,
to recovery and mental prep. As a sport biomechanist, Marcus is especially
curious about how the human body moves and performs under pressure, and
how to equip athletes with the right strength, skill, and strategies to
succeed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A father of two and passionate advocate for youth development, Marcus
believes science should serve people—helping athletes not only win, but
grow with purpose and resilience.</p>
<h4><strong>Correction</strong></h4>
<p>The episode misgeneralises that "distance over time is velocity or speed."
While this may serve as a practical shorthand in the sporting context,
strictly scientifically speaking, the two terms are not interchangeable.
Distance over time is speed, not velocity. Speed is the rate at which an
object covers distance, while velocity is the rate at which an object changes
its position in a specific direction.</p>

<p><strong>JANICE: </strong>From Science Centre Singapore, this is <em>Void Deck</em>,
a podcast spotlighting the science in Singaporean life. I'm your host,
Janice. The athletic achievements of Joseph Schooling and Shanti Pereira
have captivated and inspired Singaporeans. Today we’re asking: what technologies
are used to train Singapore's top athletes? To find out more, we chatted
with sport biomechanist Dr. Marcus Lee, who previously served as Head of
Sport Science and Medicine at Sport Singapore.</p>
<p><em>[Upbeat electronica jingle]</em>
</p>
<p><strong>JANICE: </strong>Thank you for joining us on the show!</p>
<p><strong>DR. LEE: </strong>Thank you. Thank you for having me.</p>
<p><strong>JANICE:</strong> Now, let's dive straight into our very first question
of the day. How would you explain biomechanics to people who have no science
background?</p>
<p><strong>DR. LEE: </strong>So the word <em>bio-</em> and mechanics, <em>bio-</em> refers
to biological systems, things that are alive, [while] mechanics refers
to forces, whether it's producing forces or absorbing forces, mainly anchored
on the science of physics. So [biomechanics] is really utilising the laws
of physics to understand the movements of biological systems.</p>
<p>My space is sport biomechanics, so naturally it's adapting this in a sporting
context, but that's what you’ll find on Google. In the actual practice
when we work with athletes, during my time, I came up with a model, it's
called the 4S model: Structure, Strength, Skill, Strategy.</p>
<p>To explain what we do, essentially in sport, our athletes are moving their
musculoskeletal structure or body structure with the appropriate strength
to satisfy the skill requirements of the sport. So how you need to move
your body is related to what the sport requires you to do, and, all else
being equal, by knowing your strengths and weaknesses, and that of your
opponents, and strategising–so that's the fourth “S”–you've got a better
chance of winning.</p>
<p><strong>JANICE:</strong> Awesome. So, to sum this all up, biomechanics
is really the science of how living things move.</p>
<p><strong>DR. LEE: </strong>Absolutely, and perform skillfully.</p>
<p><strong>JANICE:</strong> Now let’s move on to our second question: what
role does a sport scientist play in an athlete's success?</p>
<p><strong>DR. LEE:</strong> Hmm. I guess you can look at us as a supporter
of the coach and the athlete, and this triad becomes really, really important.
So the athlete is the most important person in this whole triad, and we're
always athlete-centred, because at the end of the day, they are the ones
in the arena competing, they are the ones who go through the ups and downs
of winning and losing, and they are the ones who, when they have breakthrough
performances, actually have the power to inspire Singaporeans [to] dream
of wanting to achieve more.</p>
<p>The coaches are also very important because they are the ones guiding
the athletes along the way. I always say that athletes and coaches are
scientists themselves, because everyday they are thinking of ways to improve.</p>
<p>A sports scientist’s role is to listen to what the coach and the athletes
are talking about, and then [use] scientific knowledge to say, hey, would
this work? Would that work? And use a scientific approach to hopefully
get us to increase our chance of achieving the outcomes that we want.</p>
<p><em>[Bright short musical transition]</em>
</p>
<p><strong>JANICE:</strong> So, what type of equipment or technologies do
you use to train Team Singapore's athletes in general?</p>
<p><strong>DR. LEE:</strong> I remembered I was showing a <em>Straits Times</em> reporter
around, he was asking me, what are some of the technologies that you use
that we may not know of? For example, we use a core temperature monitoring
pill that, um –</p>
<p><strong>JANICE: </strong>Monitoring pill?</p>
<p><strong>DR. LEE: </strong>We have actually got to put it up the rectum.<em> [Laughs sheepishly]</em> It's
a bit different –</p>
<p><strong>JANICE: </strong>Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>DR. LEE: </strong>– but that gives you the most accurate readings
of core temperature. So for example, if you wanted to monitor the core
temperature of our sailors out in the heat, right, and obviously temperature
is really, really important, that's something that we use. There's data
that is transmitted from the pill out and we can monitor that live. That's
one example.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We put eye trackers on our athletes, so we are able to look through the
eyes of our athletes, where they're looking at, how long for, and there's
some science to that.</p>
<p><strong>JANICE: </strong>Eye trackers. Would they be in the form of glasses,
or contact lenses that they can actually wear?</p>
<p><strong>DR. LEE: </strong>They are in the form of glasses, but these days,
they can even be in the form of headbands. Back in the day, yes, they are
in the form of contact lenses.</p>
<p><strong>JANICE:</strong> Wow.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>DR. LEE:</strong> Yeah, but that’s a bit more invasive. That's
an example. We put reflective markers on our athletes' bodies and we recreate
their movements in 3D and use animation to study how they move. So yeah,
all sorts of stuff.</p>
<div class="iframe-wrapper">
<iframe height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9MWQnHG9kXM?si=CM7t589lpG2vobkY&amp;controls=0"></iframe>
</div>
<p><strong>JANICE:</strong> Yeah, that's really cool. The pill in the rectum
one is really cool. I've not heard of that so far. Alright, let's move
on to our next question. How do you use technology to study the biomechanics
of Shanti Pereira's sprinting and provide a competitive edge?</p>
<p><strong>DR. LEE: </strong>Well, it starts off by engaging with the coach
and the athlete to find out one question: if you were to narrow down to
three things that will help you make a breakthrough, what might they be?
And one of the things that we identified together was that if you looked
at Shanti's races back in the day, she would always trail behind her competitors
at the start, and then she catches up.</p>
<p>So what we did was focus on the start. We took Shanti into the lab, and
interestingly—I mentioned [the 4S model]: Structure, Strength, Skill, Strategy–structurally,
Shanti is very talented.</p>
<p>Strength-wise, when we did various kinds of strength measurements—and
these measurements are, I have to say, quite different from what you see
in the gym, these are very, very specific strength measurements using different
systems—what we found interestingly in the lab [was] on her third step,
the breaking forces were actually higher than the propulsive forces.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And you would think hmm, how does that work? Because ideally, as you're
pushing on the ground, Newton's third law, you know, every action has a
reaction. The more force you're able to apply to the ground in the appropriate
direction, it pushes you forward. But what we found was the breaking forces
on the third step was actually higher, so that led to a whole bunch of
interventions together with the coaches to try and optimise that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At that time, we landed on a strategy to improve upon her technique, or
in biomechanics, we say kinematics. Kinematics refers to the movement quality,
whereas kinetics refers to the forces involved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So If I can remember correctly —because that was sometime ago, and Shanti
obviously now is performing at a much different level, kudos to her for
her hard work—</p>
<p><strong>JANICE: </strong>Yes, kudos, kudos!</p>
<p><strong>DR. LEE:</strong> Yeah, and [to] her coach, really, because all
we did was a very small part.</p>
<p>When you talk about technology, we did two things.</p>
<p>The first was with the 3D motion analysis system. We created some script
using programming. We were then able to provide real time feedback. What
real time feedback means is as you're moving, we identify different parts
of your body that we want to track live and guide the movement to where
we want it to go.</p>
<p>If the foot position off the ground is too high or too low, it's not giving
that appropriate distance ahead, therefore Shanti was not able to apply
the optimal forces. We've identified what that foot height [to give optimal
forces] is. We can then program it to say, okay, when you're moving in
space, if the foot height is not that, we want that auditory feedback.</p>
<p>Second thing we did was we collaborated with a company to optimise these
magnetic gates.&nbsp; When Shanti goes through these gates, basically,
it gives a distance and time matrix. You can start plotting a velocity-distance
curve, so we know how fast she's moving across different distances, and
using machine learning, you could count how many steps she took, what was
the trajectory of her feet, how long she was in the air for, etc.</p>
<p><em>[Editor's note: While velocity-distance curves appear in sport science literature measuring athletic performance in sports like <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jshs.2019.10.002" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">sprinting</a> and swimming, from a general science perspective, there is no velocity-distance relationship. Velocity is the rate of change of displacement (not distance) over time. For more on speed vs. velocity, see <a href="https://www.sciencing.com/speed-vs-velocity-whats-the-difference-why-it-matters-w-examples-13720226/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>this resource</u></a>.]</em>
</p>
<p>So that played quite a big role prior to the Asian Games in her preparation.
And again, kudos to her and her coach, they did extremely well at the Asian
Games and created history.</p>
<p><strong>JANICE:</strong> Yeah, they did. Awesome. Well, it really sounds
like there's quite a lot of modern, high-tech training equipment available
out there, but that leads me to my next question. You previously shared
that, you know, training equipment, they don't always need to be fancy,
right? Could you share the story of how a simple camera helped Joseph Schooling
achieve his Olympic gold medal?</p>
<p><strong>DR. LEE: </strong>Well, first, I want to say again, it's kudos
to him and the coaches.</p>
<p><strong>JANICE: </strong>Yes, kudos!</p>
<p><strong>DR. LEE:</strong> No technology or science can claim to create
those results. What did happen at the Olympics was that a colleague of
mine from the biomechanics team was on the ground. Often in swimming or
race-based sports, we do something called performance analysis, and it's
pretty simple.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>So when you're at the pool, lane ropes, they've got different colours.
The different colours represent different distances, so by filming you
swimming, I'm able to have a time element and to know how much time you
spent to cover a certain amount of distance. Distance over time is velocity
or speed. And we plot that curve across distance, so we've got a velocity-distance
curve.</p>
<p><em>[Editor’s note: Although using velocity or speed interchangeably may be a practical shorthand in the context of sports, strictly scientifically speaking, distance over time is speed, not velocity. Speed is the rate at which an object covers distance, while velocity is the rate at which an object changes its position in a specific direction.]</em>
</p>
<p>On the ground, by that time, Joseph Schooling was already third at the
World Championships. He was doing really, really well. And because these
curves are plotted not just during a major competition, but at various
competitions and during trainings, the team knew what Joseph Schooling's
best timing would look like in his first fifteen metres, in his next twenty-five,
fifty, so on and so forth. And you can imagine, we can actually plot a
curve to say if Joseph was able to do all these timings, what would the
eventual timing look like?</p>
<p>So at the Olympics, Michael Phelps was still swimming. But Michael Phelps
was also quite a bit older, so when his curves were plotted and Joe's curves
were plotted, it was quite clear that because Michael Phelps was still
taking part in many events, the velocity-distance curves were suggesting
that he was gradually slowing down more and more across the days, so that
signalled to the team that maybe at this age he is fatiguing a lot quicker
these days.</p>
<p>The team knew that if Joseph was able to do his best timings on the day,
and based on Michael Phelps's curves that suggested he was slowing down
over the days, he could have a chance to create history.</p>
<p>So therefore, my colleague did some calculations and made a recommendation
to the coaches and Joseph to say that in your first fifty metres, if you
want to turn half a body length ahead of Michael Phelps, this would be
the time, and this will be the number of strokes, and then the second fifty,
this will be the time, and this will be the number of strokes.</p>
<p>That's just mathematical. At the end of the day, Joseph had to do it himself.</p>
<p><strong>JANICE: </strong>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>DR. LEE: </strong>Why half a body length is because generally
in swimming, if you are turning side by side with a veteran, it will be
a dogfight, and somebody who's won so many gold medals at Olympics–it’s
going to be challenging. Yeah, but for somebody who's fatiguing–so there's
a bit of psychology here–if you are able to turn half a body length ahead,
it could be quite demoralising for somebody who's a bit older.</p>
<p>On that day itself, Joe basically outdid whatever recommendations that
we made, so he turned, and true enough, he was, I think, three quarters
body length ahead. So that's a little, little role that the team played
in his race during the Olympic finals.</p>
<p><strong>JANICE: </strong>What a story. Wow.</p>
<p><em>[Short contemplative musical transition]</em>
</p>
<p><strong>JANICE: </strong>Moving on to our last question of the day: how
can Singaporeans use technology easily available to them, for example,
their phones or their fitness trackers, to improve their fitness?</p>
<p><strong>DR. LEE:</strong> I get asked this question quite a bit. The very
fact that we all have a mobile phone, it really is revolutionary. In a
sense, before mobile phones had cameras, video cameras, all these were
standalone pieces of equipment, so to even film oneself and do simple measurements,
it was a big task, but now with a phone, with high-speed cameras, you can
capture yourself moving in slow motion. It really is up to one's own creativity
on what you want to do if you're looking at improving the quality of your
movements.</p>
<p>Just filming yourself and reviewing it, doing a quick ChatGPT search on
what needs to be done, you could do that. There's some apps that allow
you to draw on the images. You can put two images side by side. You can
compare a pre and a post. You can draw different angles. There are even
apps that suggest what optimal movement looks like, but I'm always a little
bit sceptical about that because we all move in different ways.</p>
<p>You and I, we can run a hundred metres and get to the finishing line at
exactly the same speed, but move in very different ways. So, while apps
and technology [are] useful to look at all these things, you do need a
discerning eye to know what are the areas that if you intervene in, it
will make a difference compared with not.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>JANICE: </strong>Alright, and that’s all the time we have here
for today. Thank you Dr. Marcus Lee for coming on the show.</p>
