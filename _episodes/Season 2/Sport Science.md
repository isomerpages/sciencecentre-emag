<h4><strong>Guest Biography</strong></h4>
<p>Dr. Marcus Lee is Director of Special Projects at the National Youth Council
and also serves as Director and Principal Sport Biomechanist at the High
Performance Sport Institute, Sport Singapore. A former Head of Sport Science
and Medicine, Marcus has led teams behind the scenes to support Team Singapore
athletes across various sports at major competitions like the Olympics,
Asian Games and World Championships—making sure they’re not just ready
to compete, but ready to thrive.</p>
<p>Drawing from biomechanics, physiology, nutrition, psychology and medicine,
he and his team work closely with coaches and athletes to improve performance,
reduce injury risks, and fine-tune every detail—from strength and movement,
to recovery and mental prep. As a sport biomechanist, Marcus is especially
curious about how the human body moves and performs under pressure, and
how to equip athletes with the right strength, skill, and strategies to
succeed.</p>
<p>A father of two and passionate advocate for youth development, Marcus
believes science should serve people—helping athletes not only win, but
grow with purpose and resilience.</p>
<h4><strong>Correction</strong></h4>
<p>The episode misgeneralises that "distance over time is velocity or speed."
While this may serve as a practical shorthand in the sporting context,
strictly scientifically speaking, the two terms are not interchangeable.
Distance over time is speed, not velocity. Speed is the rate at which an
object covers distance, while velocity is the rate at which an object changes
its position in a specific direction.</p>
