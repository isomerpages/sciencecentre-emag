<h4><strong>Episode 3: Is Your Phone Making You More Kiasu? with Dr. Jean Liu</strong></h4>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/about-one-in-two-s-porean-youth-has-problematic-smartphone-use-imh-study" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">a study by IMH</a>,
about 1 in 3 Singaporeans aged 15 - 65 are reported to have problematic
amounts of smartphone usage in their daily lives. But what happens when
we’re seeing our peers on their 5th couples trip to Japan on Instagram?
Does it make us more “kiasu” about our own lives? Can our brains get so
overloaded with digital content to the point of “brain rot?” What can we
do to develop healthier relationships with our devices? Behavioural scientist
Dr. Jean Liu shares her insights.</p>

<p><strong>JANICE:</strong> This is Void Deck, a podcast from Science Centre
Singapore exploring local science stories. I'm your host, Janice. Today,
we're asking: is your phone making you more kiasu? According to the Institute
of Mental Health, <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/about-one-in-two-s-porean-youth-has-problematic-smartphone-use-imh-study" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">1 in 3 Singaporeans struggle with problematic phone use</a>.
Could doom-scrolling and social media addiction make our brains more fearful
of missing out? To help us understand the psychology behind our screen
habits, we talked with behavioural scientist Dr. Jean Liu.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>[Short musical interlude]</em>
</p>
<p><strong>JANICE: </strong>Dr. Jean, welcome to the show. Before we dive
into the questions, would you like to give a quick introduction about yourself
to our listeners?</p>
<p><strong>DR. LIU: </strong>Yes, I'm a psychology researcher and I specialise
in looking at the impact of technology like social media and screen time
on youths.</p>
<p><strong>JANICE: </strong>Awesome. So firstly, what is kiasu-ness, and
is it something that can be measured or studied?</p>
<p><strong>DR. LIU: </strong>Yes, kiasu-ness is when you kind of look over
your shoulder and you think, ah, that person is doing something and, or,
that person has something that I want, and you feel you need to go and
get it too, or do the same thing.</p>
<p>It's actually not a Singaporean phenomenon, even though we often say,
ah, Singaporeans so kiasu. The West call it <a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/understanding-fomo" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">FOMO</a>,
researchers call it social comparison. It's the basic idea that we turn
over our shoulder, look at somebody else, and we want that too.</p>
<p>Of course, the Singaporean story that we tell is that if the hawker centre
has a queue, we must join it, even if we don't know what it's selling.
That is fear of missing out. The West would call it the fear of missing
out.</p>
<p><strong>JANICE: </strong>So you would say that the culture of the kiasuness
that we have as Singaporeans will make us more susceptible to FOMO, when
using social media?</p>
<p><strong>DR. LIU:</strong> Yeah, it's funny. I think researchers often link
the two together. First, let me unpack social media a little bit. That
term actually means quite a lot of things, the landscape has changed quite
a fair bit.</p>
<p>It's everything from your social networking sites, and that's what most
people think about, your Facebook, your Instagram, to the content sites
like YouTube, and then you also have your messaging [apps] like WhatsApp,
and of course there are the hybrid ones as well that combine a few of these
features.</p>
<p>When we think about FOMO, most of the research has been done on <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-asymmetric-brain/202106/fomo-and-social-media?msockid=1a0bfdea72326f2a2594e83f73686e47" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">FOMO and the social networking sites</a>.
The typical story that we hear, and what research seems to find, is that
if you are very afraid of missing out, then you are most vulnerable to
using social media the most, especially the social networking sites like
Facebook and Instagram, and you're also most vulnerable to the negative
effects of it.</p>
<p>So for example, if you are left out in a WhatsApp group, that's going
to affect you the most if you're very FOMO. Otherwise, if you’re quite
thick-skinned, and you know, you don't really care what's going on around
you, it seems you aren't as affected by the consequences of social media.</p>
<p><strong>JANICE:</strong> In that case, from a neuroscience perspective,
why do you think social media is so addictive? I personally would like
to know, because I, too, find a hard time trying to disengage from social
media. Why do you think it's so addictive?</p>
<p><strong>DR. LIU: </strong>Yeah, I think again, we think of the different
range of social media platforms, right, we have the Tik Toks, the YouTubes,
where there's the infinite scroll. We just keep watching over and over
again. When we stop, something automatically plays, and then, you know,
we thought we're going to spend half an hour on it, all of a sudden, we
have spent three hours on it.</p>
<p><strong>JANICE: </strong>Yes, correct.</p>
<p><strong>DR. LIU: </strong>Time flies from us, and I think no one will
deny that it's enjoyable, right? I mean, we watch it cause it's fun to
watch. In an earlier generation, television was like that as well, right.
It's an enjoyable activity, and then time flies.</p>
<p>Of course, there's the other side as well. The WhatsApp messages that
keep coming in. There's the Facebook, Instagram notifications that keep
coming in, and that, I think, works on a different level.</p>
<p>Psychologists liken it to gambling sometimes. We ask ourselves, you know,
what makes something rewarding, and the kind of way that rewards are given
is intermittent. You cannot predict [it], and then it comes up every once
in a while. That kind of reward contingencies make you use it the most.</p>
<p>So things like WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, you know, you can't really
predict when someone is going to give you a like, reply your messages,
so you keep checking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think there are some things that are inbuilt, some things that by nature
they're rewarding, and therefore we sometimes feel ourselves not being
able to control our usage or using it a little bit more than we had anticipated.</p>
<p><strong>JANICE:</strong> So would you say that we associate social media
as, like, a little platform that gives out gifts to our brain whenever
we receive likes?</p>
<p><strong>DR. LIU:</strong> People often say, oh, the dopamine hit. You often
hear that word, the dopamine hit. I always try to break down the evidence
a little bit, as a scientist.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Dopamine skeletal formula" src="/images/Dopamine.svg">

<p><em>Skeletal formula of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dopamine" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>dopamine</u></a>. Source: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Dopamine#/media/File:Dopamine.svg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Wikimedia Commons</u></a></em>
</p>
<p>What do we mean by the dopamine hit? There's no denying that yeah, it's
rewarding, but actually there's very little research that tells us that
when you use a digital device, you get a dopamine hit.</p>
<p>To actually say that, yeah, dopamine is released at that point of time,
you need to use something called a PET scan [<a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/10123-pet-scan" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Positron emission tomography scan</a>],
and that's when you, you know, inject a radioactive tracer, and that helps
you to see as a proxy whether there's dopamine activity in the brain.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="PET machine" src="/images/Screenshot_2025_12_03_at_6_33_48_PM.png">
</div>
<p><em>Positron emission tomography machine. Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Positron_emission_tomography.png" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Wikimedia Commons</u></a>.</em>
</p>
<p>So <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9607763/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">one study</a> has
done that in 1998, involving eight people.</p>
<p><strong>JANICE:</strong> Woah.</p>
<p><strong>DR. LIU:</strong> What they found was that, yeah, after people
play a video game--so not even the modern [devices]--this was 1998, right,
so [they found playing] the video game, it's consistent with some level
of dopamine release. And that study has been used a lot to say, aha, see,
when you play, when you [have] screen time, you get a dopamine release.</p>
<p>But actually researchers will then take a pause and say, what does it
mean to have increased dopamine release? Because dopamine is involved in
a lot of other things like movement. Working out probability. So just because
you see a dopamine increase doesn't mean it was addictive.</p>
<p>The other side of the neuroscience research tells us that you know, yeah,
it's true that when you anticipate getting a social media like, when you
anticipate receiving a message from a friend on WhatsApp, or seeing a TikTok
video, you have increased activity in the <a href="https://www.snexplores.org/article/scientists-say-ventral-striatum" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ventral striatum</a>,
which is a part of your brain involved in rewards.</p>
<p>But anticipating anything that is nice, [something] people enjoy, like
money, photographs of attractive people, food--anticipating any of these
also has the same kind of neural activity, so it just means that yeah,
we find it rewarding. That's I think as much as you can say about the neuroscience
of it.</p>

</p>
<p><strong>JANICE: </strong>Speaking about that, recently, I believe there's
a lot of buzz about this thing called “brain rot.” Not sure if you heard
of it. It's a slang term that describes the supposed mental decline from
consuming too much trivial or low-quality online content. But in your take,
is brain rot actually real? Does exposure to this kind of content actually
affect our brain functions?</p>
<p><strong>DR. LIU: </strong>I think we, as a society, always feel the need
to be productive at all cost[s], and so if we see what we term brainless
content, we feel [guilty]. I mean, it was in the case of television as
well, right, where people, parents often would tell kids, how are you watching
that kind of content, can't you go and study? Can't you do some, watch
an educational show instead?</p>
<p>Even for adults, we feel that pressure. Sometimes we should be reading
an e-book. We shouldn't, you know [be consuming other content], but actually,
if you think about your own life, there are just times when you're tired
and there's no way you're going to do an online course at that point of
time.</p>
<p>You just want to relax, and I think much of this, what we call the “brain
rot,” serves a purpose, which is to help us relax. Just like how in a different
generation you turn on the TV at the end of the day, and there's nothing
wrong with doing that.</p>
<p>In fact, sometimes researchers now tell people who are insomniacs having
difficulty sleeping that maybe some screen time can help you wind down
and go to sleep, which is counter-intuitive, I mean, for a long time, people
thought that it was the other way around. You watch screens, you won't
be able to sleep, but now they're finding out that hey, actually, it helps
you to wind down.</p>
<p>So there's nothing wrong with watching some, what people would call, “mindless”
content. I think where it becomes a problem is two areas. One, sometimes
the content is a lot about news, and if you spend too much time searching
about news, what we know is that people get anxious because often news
is negative. We hear about the geopolitical crisis. We hear about climate
change. You hear so much of it and you keep checking it, you become more
anxious.</p>
<p>The other thing we have to watch for is if we spend too much time on it,
and then you neglect all the other things you should do. So I think those
are the two things to watch out for.</p>
<p><strong>JANICE:</strong> Okay, so actually the supposed “brain rot” is
okay. It’s okay content for people to consume--</p>
<p><strong>DR. LIU:</strong> -- in moderation!</p>
<p><strong>JANICE: </strong>In moderation, yes.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. LIU:</strong> Balanced!</p>
<p><strong>JANICE:</strong> [Laughs] Balanced, yes. I think this will ensure,
you know, people not to feel so worried if they're consuming such content
in moderation.</p>
<p>Alright, and so let's move on to our next question of the day, given how
common it is for people to be on their phones for hours at a stretch, me
included, does being online too much cause your brain function[s], such
as memory retention or attention span to deteriorate?</p>
<p><strong>DR. LIU: </strong>It's a hard question to ask. I mean, it's a
very coarse matter. People have tried to do this kind of research where
they say, okay, I'll give you a survey. You tell me how many hours of phone
use you've been using, how many hours of screen time over the last week,
and I will measure your brain function, or I'll give you a memory test.</p>
<p>First, it's notoriously difficult to self-report how much time you spend
on your phone because you tend to use it during the day, so those correlational
studies are quite--it's hard to interpret.</p>
<p>Second, now that we use the phone all the time or our laptops all the
time, is it meaningful to get a concept like that? Because of course, the
activity that you're doing is so different, and the average staff today
goes on the computer and works all day on the screen.</p>
<p>Do you differentiate that from the, you know, going on the bus and scrolling
through TikTok videos? So I think you have to break it down a little bit
and also measure it objectively, and ideally not just through a correlational
study, but actually trace people over time, or actually do experimental
studies. Those kinds of studies are much harder to do, and people haven't
quite done that, or you know, it's just much less.</p>
<p>So the answer is that I don't think the verdict is out on just general
screen use and brain development, it’s much harder to trace that.</p>
<p>But we do know about certain activities online that change the way you
function. For example, people have found that increasingly we're so used
to Googling information that when you ask people about a topic, the way
they sort the information out seems to be by thinking, okay, how am I going
to Google it <em>[editor’s note: read this <a href="https://time.com/5383389/google-history-search-information/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">TIME article</a> for more on this phenomenon]</em>.
So I think it changes the way we organise information and so forth.</p>
<p><em>[Short musical transition]</em>
</p>
<p><strong>JANICE:</strong> Now moving on to our next question, what do you
think we can do as a society that we can do to develop healthier relationships
with our devices?</p>
<p><strong>DR. LIU: </strong>We need to find balance. That's the keyword:
balance.</p>
<p><strong>JANICE:</strong> The keyword for today, balance.</p>
<p><strong>DR. LIU: </strong>Balance, because it's not about saying, oh,
it's so bad, we need to ban everything, and then you go and hide in your
room without a device or any screen time. It's also not about saying it's
so good, and there are no problems with it. Somehow in between those two
realities, we need to find balance, right.</p>
<p>One of the researchers<em> [editor’s note:<a href="https://calnewport.com/on-digital-minimalism/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"> Cal Newport</a>] </em>came
up with this idea of <a href="https://calnewport.com/on-digital-minimalism/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">digital minimalism</a>.
It's not about saying, how much time am I using with my phone or my devices?
It's about saying, think of your bigger life goals--is this getting in
the way of your goals or not? And I think that's a very empowering kind
of message, right? It's not about the absolute number of hours. It's really
about, is this serving you or are you serving it? And working that out
takes some art. But yeah, I think that's the balance that we need.</p>
<p><strong>JANICE:</strong> I like that: digital minimalism. Okay, I shall
do my part to do that as well. Next question. Do you have any creative
or unusual hacks for reducing screen time?</p>
<p><strong>DR. LIU: </strong>The complaint many people have is on time use
usually, right. Ah, you know, I really need to do this assignment, this
report, and it's effortful. Often it's effortful, and then you find yourself
going on TikTok. You find yourself scrolling videos, checking your friend’s
status updates.</p>
<p>What I often do in those situations is to go somewhere without Wi-Fi,
sometimes be a bit more radical or put my phone aside so that I have that
focused time in order to do the task at hand, even if it's more effortful.
Sometimes people use what we call the Pomodoro technique as well, which
is where we say, okay, I'm going to do thirty minutes of focused work,
and then I'm going to use my phone for anything that I want, for five to
ten minutes, and that also helps people to focus.</p>
<p>I think that often is everybody's biggest complaints for each other. Parents
like to say, ah, why are you using your phone again and not doing your
homework? But even ourselves, right, and our working lives, we often get
distracted, especially for tasks we don't feel like doing.</p>
<p><strong>JANICE: </strong>That's true, that's true. So being intentional
with your phone time.</p>
<p><strong>DR. LIU: </strong>I think the other thing that I want to say is
that we're often guilty of not being present for the people around us,
and the irony is often we are taking our phones to message, so we're trying
very hard to connect with other people online, and this has to do with
FOMO as well, right? We don't want to miss out the message from our friends,
but then we take out our phone, even when we are sitting and having dinner
with somebody else, and that affects the person sitting next to you.</p>
<p>My research group did this line of research, and we found that people
find that equivalent to ostracism. They find it horrible. They don't like
it, and they feel like, oh, you have left them out.</p>
<p>But we don't think of that. We're just mindlessly taking our phones even
when we are in front of people. So my caution is on two sides. I would
say, if you are in front of somebody else, you really have to think about
how your phone use affects them, and I would say put it away if you can,
and if you can't, explain why you're using your phone. The other side,
of course, is time use, and if you need to be productive, then take radical
steps to do that.</p>
<p><strong>JANICE: </strong>Yes, I like that. Being, basically, in the present
moment.</p>
<p><strong>DR. LIU:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>JANICE: </strong>Then appreciating those who are around you right
now.</p>
<p><em>[Short musical interlude]</em>
</p>
<p><strong>JANICE: </strong>Just to wrap up this session, maybe one last
question to Dr. Jean. So do you think your phone is making you more kiasu?</p>
<p><strong>DR. LIU:</strong> I think it depends. So I'm going to give the
careful answer to say it depends on how you're using it. If you're looking
at other people's lives and feeling like, oh, why is that person doing
that amazing thing, I feel like I'm missing out on something? Then yes,
it's making you more kiasu, but if you're using it for healthier ways of
connecting with friends, organising activities, then no, it's not making
you more kiasu.</p>
<p><strong>JANICE: </strong>Alright, thank you so much for joining us, Dr.
Jean, and we hope to see you again next time.</p>
<p><strong>DR. LIU: </strong>Thank you.</p>
