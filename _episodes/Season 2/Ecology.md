<h4><strong>Episode 4: Are Our Heritage Trees Actually Non-Native? with Dr. Shawn Lum</strong></h4>
<p>Scattered across Singapore are 255 registered Heritage Trees—remarkable
for their majesty, cultural value, and the histories these green landmarks
are rooted in. While some are native, many aren’t. So how did our heritage
trees end up here, and what makes them worth conserving? In this episode,
tropical forest ecologist Dr. Shawn Lum walks us through the hidden world
of our heritage trees, the work that goes into conserving them, and why
they matter more than we might think.</p>

<p><strong>JANICE: </strong>From Science Centre Singapore, this is <em>Void Deck</em>,
a podcast where we explore the universe from the heartlands together with
STEM changemakers. I'm your host, Janice. Scattered across Singapore are
<a href="https://heritagetrees.nparks.gov.sg/heritage-tree-register/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>255 registered heritage trees</u>
</a> <em>[editor’s note: updated as of 1 June 2025]</em>, remarkable for their
age, size, and unique histories. While these trees are important landmarks
of our green city, some aren't originally from Singapore. So today we're
asking: are our heritage trees actually non-native? To learn more, we talked
with tropical forest ecologist Dr. Shawn Lum.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>[Short musical interlude]</em>
</p>
<p><strong>JANICE: </strong>Welcome to the show, Dr. Lum.</p>
<p><strong>DR. LUM: </strong>Janice, thank you very much. Delighted to be
here.</p>
<p><strong>JANICE: </strong>Would you like to give a quick introduction about
yourself to our listeners?</p>
<p><strong>DR. LUM:</strong> I'm Shawn Lum, I'm a tropical forest ecologist.
I teach at the NTU Asian School of the Environment. Been there for the
past ten years and before that, about twenty years at the National Institute
of Education (NIE) in the Biology Group.</p>
<p><strong>JANICE: </strong>So as someone who works closely with Singapore's
natural environments, could you help our listeners better understand what
exactly is a heritage tree and what makes these trees different from the
ones we see every other day?</p>
<p><strong>DR. LUM:</strong> Heritage trees in one sense aren't any different
from other trees that we see, except they've maybe reached some exceptionally
majestic size or have quite a bit of historic or cultural value.</p>
<p>There are these programs in cities all around the world called exceptional
trees, champion trees, you know, so on, and the <a href="https://heritagetrees.nparks.gov.sg/heritage-tree-scheme/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Heritage Tree scheme</u></a> was
introduced by the National Parks Board (NParks) about twenty-five years
ago. The intention was to really highlight trees of exceptional majesty
or beauty. And so there are a <a href="https://heritagetrees.nparks.gov.sg/nominate-tree/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>few criteria</u></a>.
There's a minimum size, basically [a] circumference of five metres.</p>
<p>In some cases, some species just don't grow that large. So if a tree doesn't
meet that minimum criteria, the alternative is to have an exceptional size
for that species. And then there'll be other considerations like, does
it have maybe some particular value for that place or the people associated
with that tree that might add to its heritage status.</p>
<p>And then once it's nominated, then a panel of experts from NParks and
outside, then we'll evaluate that tree and make sure that not only does
it meet [the] criteria for size and it's healthy and so on, but it also
has a pretty good future. In other words, there are no impending plans
to clear that area for development projects, for example.</p>
<p><strong>JANICE: </strong>Awesome, so I think you mentioned having a
<a href="https://heritagetrees.nparks.gov.sg/heritage-tree-panel/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Heritage Tree Panel</u>
</a>, right?</p>
<p><strong>DR. LUM: </strong>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>JANICE: </strong>So being one of the representative[s] on that
panel, how do you and the rest of the panel decide, or rather, [what] do
you look out for when you're deciding what trees deserve that title? Can
you walk us through that process?</p>
<p><strong>DR. LUM:</strong> It’s a fairly well practised drill at this point.
We meet once a year to go through nominees that have been not only nominated,
but screened by a team of arborists from NParks. When we first started
the scheme in the early 2000s, there was kind of [a] flurry of nominations
and anyone could nominate. Janice, you could <a href="https://heritagetrees.nparks.gov.sg/nominate-tree/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>nominate a Heritage Tree</u></a>,
you know, so I'm holding [you] to it.</p>
<p><strong>JANICE: </strong>Awesome, good to hear that anyone can nominate
[these] trees.</p>
<p><strong>DR. LUM:</strong> In fact, people are encouraged. I think the idea
really isn't just to highlight trees of exceptional size, although that
would be the criteria. I mean, you're in the science communication field,
you've heard of this condition called <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190425-plant-blindness-what-we-lose-with-nature-deficit-disorder" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>plant blindness</u></a>,
where basically you see the plants, but you actually don't see them. You
don't really notice them other than being part of the background.</p>
<p><em>[Editor’s note: To combat plant blindness, read this related Void Deck article titled <a href="https://voiddeck.science.edu.sg/sg-trees/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>“A Guide to Singapore’s Street Trees”</u></a> and try going on a short stroll around your neighbourhood to notice the trees nearest to you!]</em>
</p>
<p>I think the idea of the Heritage Tree Scheme, as well as similar schemes
all around the world, is really to not just celebrate trees, but to encourage
people to take notice of them, to develop a relationship with them, to
maybe even have their own favourite tree. And even if it doesn't have heritage
status in a formal sense, it doesn't make it any less valuable to the individual
person who finds beauty and meaning, and maybe some sort of solace in getting
to know a tree, an individual tree better.</p>
<p><strong>JANICE:</strong> I love that. Really teaching everyone to slow
down, you know, appreciate the trees that are around you.</p>
<p><strong>DR. LUM: </strong>Yeah, they're remarkable things. And if you
could think of, you know, consider what a tree might have seen, especially
in a place like Singapore, where the landscape changes so quickly. Imagine
the life of a tree, if it could share with you what it has witnessed, the
people it's seen, and the various cultural and landscape changes--it'd
be quite a story.</p>
<p><em>[Short musical transition]</em>
</p>
<p><strong>JANICE: </strong>One species that stands out as <a href="https://heritagetrees.nparks.gov.sg/did-you-know/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>the most represented [tree species]</u></a> in
the Heritage Tree Register is the magnificent Rain Tree, also known as <em><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/flora/3/1/3106" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Samanea saman</u></a></em>,
if I'm pronouncing that correctly.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

<p><em>Infographic showing the large, umbrella-shaped crown of the rain tree along with its powderpuff flowers, leaves, and seedpods. Graphic credit: <a href="https://voiddeck.science.edu.sg/sg-trees/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Jansen Michelle/Void Deck</u></a>.&nbsp;</em>
</p>
<p><strong>DR. LUM:</strong> I couldn't do it better myself, Janice.</p>
<p><strong>JANICE: </strong>Awesome. Now, these umbrella shaped giants are
sprinkled all over Singapore, but many might be surprised to learn that
they are not originally from here. So could you share how this South American
species ended up in our city?</p>
<p><strong>DR. LUM:</strong> Sure, yeah. It's of course a ubiquitous tree.
It provides beautiful shade. It's a hardy species, easily transplanted,
easily propagated. It has a lot going for it, and it might be that some
individual trees are nominated as heritage trees, and there are those,
for example, that line the Padang—<a href="https://heritagetrees.nparks.gov.sg/ht-2015-255/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>that whole cluster</u></a> together
has been nominated.</p>
<p>If you think about it, plants have perhaps been the earliest examples
of globalisation. I'll talk about trees in a second, the rain tree in particular,
but if you think about the plants that have transformed the way we live,
I mean, just think of our diet in Singapore. How often do we eat tomato
or potato or chilli?</p>
<p><strong>JANICE:</strong> Daily.</p>
<p><strong>DR. LUM:</strong> Right, and it's such an integral part of our
cuisines, but then if you think about it, the potatoes [are] from South
America, tomatoes from South America, corn is from Central America and
Mexico, chilies are from Central America and Mexico, so they've been globalised
long before.</p>
<p>In fact, people think of it as an indigenous part of our culture, so plants
have been everywhere and impacting societies for centuries ever since,
well, European explorers started circling and circumnavigating the globe
and bringing things back to and moving things across around the world.
So the same with the rain tree.</p>
<p>It's from Central America. Just think about it. That was part of the big,
the great Spanish Empire, and I've looked into this, and it seems as if
the earliest introduction of rain tree to Asia, tropical Asia, was to the
Philippines, which was also a Spanish colony. And then from there, the
virtues of the rain tree must not have been unnoticed because they got
spread around.</p>
<p>And the records show that [the] rain tree was introduced to Malaya, British
Malaya, in the 1870s, so about, half a century after they were brought
to Asia, and if you go to tropical cities all around the world, there is
a kind of a common, almost global community of trees in our cities, so
rain tree could be one. Our Angsana is a contribution to the wider world,
because that's planted all over the tropics, something like trumpet tree,
all of these make up, are a set of species whose properties are well appreciated.</p>
<p>They're hardy, easy to propagate, they're beautiful, and they really have
become internationalised, so even though they're not really native, I would
still say they are a traditional part of the tropical landscape, including
Singapore, you know. In the same way that, you know, chilli, and all of
these, we adopt them as our own, they're not seen as expat food items.
They are ours. And the same thing could be said for some of these heritage
trees like rain tree.</p>
<p><em>[Short musical transition]</em>
</p>
<p><strong>JANICE: </strong>Given how special and prominent these heritage
trees are in Singapore, I would imagine looking after them requires a lot
of attention. Could you share with us what actually goes into [caring for]
and maintaining a heritage tree?</p>
<p><strong>DR. LUM: </strong>So first of all, before becoming a heritage
tree – and this is where all the pre-screening takes place – a team of
expert arborists from NParks will visually inspect the tree to make sure
it's healthy. They'll then subject it to all kinds of tests. Is it hollow
in the inside? Are there any signs of fungal rot that might prematurely
end the life of this tree? Its shape. Has it been well managed in the past?
In other words, they want to know not only does it look beautiful now,
but will it continue to grow healthily and happily in the decades ahead?</p>
<p>So then, all heritage trees, once approved, they also have to have the
consent of either the landowner, in which case many of them are, of course,
on in parks or nature areas, so that would come under the purview of NParks,
but in other cases they might be on private land.</p>
<p>And heritage trees are outfitted with <a href="https://file.go.gov.sg/heritagetreecareguide.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>lightning protection</u></a>.
So if you look at a heritage tree, you see a copper cable running down
the side. That's because there's a lightning rod up at the top of it. You
have to pay for somebody to climb that tree, install the lightning protection,
and so on, so it's not a trivial amount of work or money that goes into--</p>
<p><strong>JANICE: </strong>Taking care of this.</p>
<p><strong>DR. LUM: </strong>Well, taking care of and designating a tree
as a heritage tree, and then there's the maintenance that has to follow.
So again, is it healthy? Is the landowner willing to pay for the lightning
protection and the continued maintenance under a kind of prescribed maintenance
regime? You know, like a health check that you and I would go to regularly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I mean, one of the other things is to also make sure that there are
no impending development plans for that area. So to nominate a heritage
tree and go through all of that, only to find that this tree has to make
way for an important infrastructure project in a few years’ time--that
doesn't happen. No, we try to avoid that at all costs. So a lot of these
nominees are put on a reserve list until the long-term status of that area
is sorted out.</p>
<p><strong>JANICE: </strong>Okay, interesting. I didn't think that you guys
would actually think that far ahead as to considering the construction,
upcoming projects.</p>
<p><strong>DR. LUM: </strong>Yes, well, if I could add, Janice, if you think
of it, so you and I, everybody here in the studio, we could each take part
in one of those <a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/treessg/one-million-trees-movement/upcoming-activities" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>One Million Tree tree plantings</u></a>.
It's a little sapling, no bigger than around, say, your thumb. And who
knows, thirty years, fifty years, hundred years from now, that tree could
grow into that five-metre size class and qualify to be a heritage tree.</p>
<p>Nobody who ever planted some of these would have ever imagined that some
of these trees would become so majestic and beautiful and bring shade and
hope to people who walk under its shade everyday, but they do become heritage
trees. I think whenever you work with things that have such a long lifespan,
I think you can't help but think ahead. You have to, because these trees
will long outlast, outlive the people who planted them and named them heritage
trees in the first place.</p>
<p>[<em>Short musical transition</em>]</p>
<p><strong>JANICE: </strong>After all of your years here working with Singapore's
magnificent trees, do you have a favourite heritage tree, and if so, where
can we find it in Singapore, and what's the story behind it?</p>
<p><strong>DR. LUM:</strong> I love them all, but there's one in particular
that I--</p>
<p><strong>JANICE:</strong> It's a favourite.</p>
<p><strong>DR. LUM:</strong> It's a, well, it's one that I look out for every
time I pass by it.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>JANICE: </strong>Aww.</p>
<p><strong>DR. LUM: </strong>So if you’re familiar with Changi Village, there's
a road there called Cranwell Road that comes off of Loyang Avenue. And
that leads into another street called Netheravon Road, and Netheravon will
bring you right to the Changi Village Hawker Market from the other side.</p>
<p>That Changi Village area used to be a forest reserve. It was called, well,
the Changi Forest Reserve, and it was designated as such by the colonial
government at the time, but then the protected status was lifted when the
British decided to turn Changi into a military area.</p>
<p>And so that forest reserve was cleared, but there were a few trees that
were left in the landscape because I guess they weren't directly in the
way of any kind of building or other development. So there were about a
dozen trees that were designated as heritage trees that were leftovers
from this Changi Forest Reserve. These are giant rainforest species that
are extremely rare, rare even in our nature reserves like Bukit Timah,
or the Central Catchment, so that there— [<em>pauses</em>] I should have
made it clear, there are two, three [trees] that I particularly look [for].</p>
<p><strong>JANICE:</strong> Okay, it's increasing, it's increasing. <em>[Laughs]</em>
</p>
<p><strong>DR. LUM:</strong> But maybe the most favourite is <a href="https://heritagetrees.nparks.gov.sg/ht-2003-113/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>[the] one on Netheravon Road</u></a>.
It's a species of <em>Shorea</em>, one of these large Meranti trees in the
rainforest. It's called <em>Shorea gibbosa </em>[<em>editor’s note: the updated scientific name for this species is <a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/flora/3/2/3218" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Richetia gibbosa</u></a>]</em>,
and now the local name escapes me for the moment [<em>editor’s note: the local name is Damar Hitam Gajah]</em>,
but what's remarkable is this tree is probably at least 300 years old.</p>
<p><strong>JANICE: </strong>Woah.</p>
<p><strong>DR. LUM: </strong>It's right next to a bus stop on Netheravon
Road, and it commands the highest point on the little bluff that overlooks
the coast.</p>
<p>Magnificent, magnificent tree, and I guess the added kind of beauty of
it for me, or the irony is that it's been around for so long, so few people
notice it. I look out for people who sit at that bus stop waiting for their
number 19 or 29, or whatever bus, and nobody really looks at that tree
that much. I think it's such a shame it, like I said, imagine what it's
seen in its three to 400 years of, you know, being around.</p>
<p></p>

</p>
<p>There are two other trees that I really do like to look out for in that
area. <a href="https://heritagetrees.nparks.gov.sg/ht-2003-49/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>One is closer to Loyang Avenue</u></a>,
another giant rainforest species called <em><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/flora/3/9/3963" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Dipterocarpus sublamellatus</u></a></em>.
That's a big mouthful of a name, but again, it's something that's so rare
in our rainforest, and there's one right in the middle of, at the entrance
to Changi Village, which nobody really notices, sadly.</p>
<p></p>

</p>
<p><strong>JANICE:</strong> It's okay, with this podcast [out]: everyone,
drop by Changi Village, look out for these trees.</p>
<p><strong>DR. LUM:</strong> Yeah, but don't trample on its roots and stress
it out, right. But yeah, it's part of our heritage, as much a part of our
heritage as a beloved building or a temple or a church.</p>
<p><em>[Editor's Note: Eager to explore the heritage trees in the Changi area?

</p>
<p>[<em>Short musical interlude</em>]</p>
<p><strong>JANICE: </strong>Dr. Shawn, to wrap this session up, what's one
thing that anyone, especially those of us without a green thumb, can do
to protect our forest?</p>
<p><strong>DR. LUM: </strong>Well, okay, [a] number of things. There’s technical
things you can do, right, or financial contributions you can make, whether
to an NGO, to the National Parks Garden City Fund. Sign up for a tree planting
exercise as part of the <a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/treessg/one-million-trees-movement/about-the-movement" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>One Million Trees Movement</u></a>.</p>
<p>So many things, but I think, ultimately, to say, take care of our forests,
and sort of by association, every forest in the world--that's a lifestyle
thing, isn't it, to be enlightened and sensitive consumers. That we don't
take more than what we need, that we try to support the people and communities
and companies who are striving to manage the landscape in a sustainable,
nature-friendly way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And ultimately, maybe this brings us back full circle, Janice, all that
starts, I believe, by just building a relationship with a tree. Getting
to know it, and that I think becomes the passport to this big, wild, miraculous
world of nature. And so I won't say go out and hug a tree, although it
is a nice, wonderful feeling, thing to do, but yeah, take a look at a tree,
observe it, get to know it, and you'll be amazed at how much your life
will be enriched by that experience.</p>
