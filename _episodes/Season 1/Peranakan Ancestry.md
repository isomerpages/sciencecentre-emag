<h4><strong>Episode 1: Tracing Peranakan Ancestry with Prof. Roger Foo (NUS Medicine)</strong></h4>
<p>You've probably seen those vibrant Peranakan shophouses in Joo Chiat –
but how did this unique mixed-heritage community come to be in Singapore?
To discover more, we speak with Prof. Roger Foo, the first Zayed bin Sultan
Al Nahyan Professor of Medicine at the National University of Singapore.
Prof. Foo was one of the researchers behind the Singapore Peranakan Genome
Project. We unravel some mind-blowing research about heritage and the human
heart. We also hear a bit about Prof. Foo's personal journey to becoming
a doctor (hint: involves a hit medical TV drama).&nbsp;

<h4><strong>Guest Biography</strong></h4>
<p>Roger Foo is Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan Professor at the NUS School of
Medicine, Vice Dean of Research, Director NUHS Cardiovascular Metabolic
Disease Translational Research Programme, Cardiovascular Research Institute,
Advisor to the NUHS Clinician Scientist Academy, and Senior Consultant
Cardiologist, National University Heart Centre. He is an NUS med school
graduate, and spent 20 years abroad on specialist training before returning
to Singapore in 2013. His training was undertaken at Kings College Hospital,
London, and Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge. He was Wellcome Trust Fellow
at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, and returned to Cambridge
to start a group as British Heart Foundation Fellow and Consultant Physician,
before eventually returning to Singapore. His lab was the first to publish
an epigenomic map of the failing human heart. More recently, he has published
an in-depth analysis of the human cardiac chromatin 3D organisation, elucidating
its changes during the heart disease response. The lab deep dives into
the heart epigenome in continuing aspirations to discover mechanisms of
disease for new therapies or biomarkers. Today, he spends a lot of time
mentoring young scientist, alongside growing research on heart disease
prevention and targets for new drug development.</p>
