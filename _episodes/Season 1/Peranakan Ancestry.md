<p>Roger Foo is Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan Professor at the NUS School of
Medicine, Vice Dean of Research, Director NUHS Cardiovascular Metabolic
Disease Translational Research Programme, Cardiovascular Research Institute,
Advisor to the NUHS Clinician Scientist Academy, and Senior Consultant
Cardiologist, National University Heart Centre. He is an NUS med school
graduate, and spent 20 years abroad on specialist training before returning
to Singapore in 2013. His training was undertaken at Kings College Hospital,
London, and Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge. He was Wellcome Trust Fellow
at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, and returned to Cambridge
to start a group as British Heart Foundation Fellow and Consultant Physician,
before eventually returning to Singapore. His lab was the first to publish
an epigenomic map of the failing human heart. More recently, he has published
an in-depth analysis of the human cardiac chromatin 3D organisation, elucidating
its changes during the heart disease response. The lab deep dives into
the heart epigenome in continuing aspirations to discover mechanisms of
disease for new therapies or biomarkers. Today, he spends a lot of time
mentoring young scientist, alongside growing research on heart disease
prevention and targets for new drug development.</p>

<p><strong>Rishii </strong>Whoa!</p>
<p><strong>Jacy </strong>That is mindblowing.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rishii </strong>So<strong> </strong>you're saying that everyone,
okay, not everyone, but a lot of the people who are listening to this podcast
are probably related to Genghis Khan.</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Foo </strong>Yeah, it's true. Yes, because if you can say
that Genghis Khan has a descendant today, then he must be an ancestor to
everybody today, if he has passed the isogenetic point.

<p><strong>Rishii </strong>Hey there, welcome to <em>Void Deck</em>, a casual
science podcast brought to you by Science Centre Singapore. We bring science
out of the labs and put scientists in singlets. Each episode, we sit back
with a local science changemaker and ask all the questions that you are
too paiseh to ask. I'm your host Rishii, and today we're joined by my colleague
Jacy, a science educator at the centre.</p>
<p><strong>Jacy </strong>Hi everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Rishii </strong>Hi Jacy, and today's episode is on tracing Peranakan
ancestry. You've probably seen those vibrant Peranakan shophouses in Joo
Chiat, but how did this unique community come to be in Singapore? To discover
more, we speak with Prof. Roger Foo, the first Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan
Professor of Medicine at the National University of Singapore.</p>
<p><strong>Jacy</strong> If you enjoy our content, hit the follow button and
show us some love with a five-star rating. Thanks for tuning in and exploring
the universe from the heartlands.</p>
<p><strong>Rishii </strong>Welcome, Prof Foo, to the podcast.</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Foo </strong>Thanks a lot, Rishii. Thanks for having me.</p>
<p><strong>Rishii </strong>Okay, so Prof, maybe we could start with just
learning more about yourself. So as a child, did you always want to be
a doctor?</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Foo </strong>So Rishii, this takes back quite a lot of years.
I would have to say that it wasn't all that clear. I lived in a HDB flat
and there was a really famous GP at the bottom of our block and my parents
were in great adoration of him. And every time that we went to see him
for our family health and so on, there was always a comment that, wow,
this guy is doing great work. So yeah, I guess it developed kind of from
there. So I worked hard, studied hard and got into medical school.</p>
<p><strong>Rishii </strong>Oh, okay. Okay. Wow. I mean, I guess we should
thank that GP that played such an inspiring role. Can I check with you,
if I’m right, you are a senior cardiologist consultant. So what made you
choose this path?</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Foo </strong>So Rishii, that one's also not too difficult.
When we were in med school, there were a few of us put together in something
known as anatomy dissection table. This is the part where we do dissection
over a human body. And the group of us were really fascinated with the
heart and we drove each other into the craziness about hearts, always.</p>
<p>Then going further, when we started seeing patients using the stethoscope,
that's also the thing that is most used by cardiologists, listening to
heart sounds. And then came the interpretation of ECGs. So at every step
of the way, there was always intrigue, at least for me in my mind, about
cardiology and how the heart functions. So it was quite clear that I would
take up that route of cardiology.</p>
<p><strong>Rishii </strong>Oh, wow. I just want to go back to the part where
you just casually mentioned dissection of the human body. So what was that
like, you know, the first time? Was it queasy?</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Foo </strong>Yeah, Rishii. Okay, so it really is interesting.
The word is cadaver, right? So these are bodies that have been donated
for the education and training of doctors. They got us into a room. At
that time, this is how it happens. All 300, I think, of us students, first
day at the dissection hall, we put our hands on each of our cadavers. Ten
of us share one. And then we do a swearing. Today we have a white coat
ceremony for incoming medical students.</p>
<p>In those days, the white coat was in this cadaver room. And then the smell
of formalin just hits you. Even today, if I were to smell it, it's something
that you will never forget.</p>
<p><strong>Rishii </strong>Wow. It's like an initiation ceremony of sorts.
We understand that you were a huge fan of <em>Grey’s Anatomy</em> when you
were growing up. I think a lot of people listening to this were probably,
maybe, a big fan of it as well. So was it anything like the TV show?</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Foo </strong>The ER or the A&amp;E in the UK really was
like that. On one of my first weeks being on call in King's College, London,
this is in the depths of South London, there were gunshot wounds that were
coming in. There were broken legs. There were drunkards that were punching
doctors. I got kicked and punched before. So it really is <em>Grey's Anatomy</em>.</p>
<p>And also having to familiarise myself with all the slang terms for different
types of drugs because here we only read it in textbooks and we don't get
exposed to it. And we don't even have, lesser knowledge, know how to treat
patients that come in with drug overdose. But there it's like bread and
butter. And if you know London, South London in the days of the 1990s really
was quite dark still. So it was quite an initiation.</p>
<p><strong>Rishii </strong>Wow, that sounds like chaos. You should have your
own <em>Grey's Anatomy</em> show. But you were saying that it was really
intense and you had to deal with gunshot wounds and all of that. This was
really in the early stages of your career. How did you even get through
the day without just being traumatised?</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Foo </strong>Oh, I was very traumatised. I mean, to be fair,
Singaporean right, Chinese boy in a very comfortable, sheltered society
of Singapore being now exposed to all this kind of horror that I'm describing
to you, which was very real, I have to say, to remind you, it was really
quite bad. On the weekends, like Saturdays and Friday evenings, ambulances
will basically rove around that area to pick up drunkards from the street
and bring them in.</p>
<p>And sometimes they are so over the hill that you don't even know what's
the cause for their unconsciousness, etc. It can be really quite hairy
and bad. I remember times when I would just run to the toilet and close
the door. Oh my God, even bringing that up now. Just for a few minutes
to chill myself in that room, in that small toilet room. But I mean, we
go past it.</p>
<p>It was interesting because I got to see another side of the world, I guess,
or of life, right? And also got to interact with all sorts of different
people of different walks of life.</p>
<p><strong>Rishii </strong>Wow, I wasn't expecting that level of intensity.
This sounds a lot worse than the TV show itself. But thank you so much
for sharing that. I think that's very exciting from our point of view.
But like you said, it was deeply traumatising as well at that time.</p>
<p>Moving on to a later stage in your career, you've also took part in many
interesting projects. And one of it would be the Singapore Peranakan Genome
Project. Could you tell us more about that and what exactly is this project
about?</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Foo </strong>Yeah, sure, Rishii. So that was the nice part
about coming back to work in Singapore because about the year 2012-2013
when I came back, it really was boom time for genomics. And here in Singapore,
there was so much resource that was being poured in. That was the key reason
why I realised I cannot not come back to Singapore now. This is a huge
opportunity. So the Peranakan project was conceived on the back of the
Singapore Genome Project.</p>
<p>So the government has put aside money. In fact, today it's still doing
it to sequence the population. So there are many people who maybe some
of you listening have already been whole genome sequence. In fact, I invite
you to go for your whole genome sequence if you like. There is a population
level sequencing project. And at that time, I mentioned to your colleague
Jacy here that there was a scientist in our institute whose expertise is
on this topic called genetic admixture.</p>
<p>So he was very keen to study the genetics of each person and look for
the mixture of ancestry. And he's from China and he's trained in the US.
And he's at that time fairly unfamiliar with Singapore, but familiar enough
to have tasted Peranakan food and realised there's this really interesting
culture. So he reached out to me.</p>
<p>I mean, we work in the same building and he asked if we would like to
carry out Peranakan project on the back of the population sequencing project.
So we managed to persuade the leaders of the population project to give
us a thousand samples, a thousand allocation to sequence Peranakan. So
we ended up sequencing 700 Peranakan and studying the genetic admixture.</p>
<p><strong>Jacy </strong>Wow, that's so cool. So maybe for the laypeople
who don't really know so much about DNA and sequencing, could you explain
a bit about what exactly is admixture?</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Foo </strong>Okay, nice Jacy. So the DNA is taken out of,
well in this case, we take it out of the blood. So we extract the blood
from these volunteers, participants, subjects, and then we isolate and
harvest the DNA out. And we, actually it's just biochemistry. It's put
into a sequencing machine and the sequencing machine reads the genetic
output, the genome of the individual.</p>
<p><strong>Jacy</strong> So something like deciphering a recipe in a sense.</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Foo </strong>Yeah, absolutely. So in each one of us, we
are made up of millions and gazillions of cells and the cells each contain
blueprint, which is our DNA.</p>
<p><strong>Rishii </strong>How do you even like read these results? Is it
like very technical or like it just tells you like, 20% Malay, 50% Chinese?
Does the system break it down in such layman terms or is it very technical?</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Foo </strong>No, no, actually it's very simple. There are
four bases that are called nucleic acids also in our DNA system. It's exactly
the same DNA that all living things are made of. So like plants, insects,
the whole world, right? Bacteria, every living thing has DNA. And the DNA
is made up of four bases or nucleic acids in different or in fermentation
and sequence, hence sequencing the term.</p>
<p>And the way that it's sequenced comes out telling you which base is in
which position. And if you wanted to, it's possible to take that result
and print it out into an encyclopaedia of yourself. Oh, wow. So for example,
if you went to the Wellcome Trust Museum in London, there is in a cupboard
the whole genome of a human being.</p>
<p>So that human being gave his blood and had himself sequenced and now it's
printed out into something like 50 volumes of his genome. So if you open
each book, 50 volumes of them, right, you will see the letters ACGT representing
the four bases. And of course, it's like hieroglyphics, right? You are
reading A, C, G, T, G, G, T, T, G, A, C, G.</p>
<p>So it's basically a long string of letters. I am told that statistically,
if you stretch out the letters, it will run for 9000 kilometres. And if
we think that there are 3 billion bases per genome, then that's several
thousand Bibles. So that's your fifty volumes.</p>
<p><strong>Rishii </strong>And that's just one person. One person's genome.</p>
<p><strong>Jacy </strong>That is a lot of information.</p>
<p><strong>Rishii </strong>To fill up a library.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jacy </strong>Yes. So I assume that in this project you took all
this information from different people and then you compared them and then
you found more about their heritage and their ancestry. So going back to
the Peranakan Genome Project, how did you manage to convince the Peranakans
to participate? What made them want to donate their blood and DNA for this?</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Foo </strong>Oh yeah, Jacy, that part is really fun. So
the Peranakan people in Singapore are a very tight-knit community and we,
or somehow or other, we know of a few Peranakan friends who are quite prominent
in that community. I suppose I can mention his name. One of them is Peter
Lee, who is very prominent in even hosting some TV shows around histories
around this area, right? Southeast Asian history.</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Foo </strong>So it wasn't hard before someone like Peter
Lee and a few of the others floated this project up to the community and
they gathered around it with great force, all wanting to participate and
contribute their DNA.</p>
<p><strong>Jacy </strong>Wow, that's nice. They must be very proud of their
heritage.</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Foo </strong>Yeah, you're right. They are. I mean, they're
also very keen to find out about this kind of ancestry questions.</p>
<p><strong>Jacy </strong>So tapping on that, how did they respond to the
results of the research?</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Foo </strong>Yeah, it's interesting. So I better be careful
what I say.<strong> </strong>A lot of them were interested to know whether
there really is so-called Malay ancestry in their genetics. There's always
this, they are much better at telling this story themselves. I mean, I'm
not Peranakan myself. There's always this legend that there was a Chinese
princess that came from China and from her, with the local Malay leaders,
gave rise to the Peranakan that we have now today.</p>
<p>There's also another legend that a lot the Chinese merchants that came
from China hooked up with local indigenous ladies and then had the Peranakan
culture and so on. So I think in a way, the genetic experiment or project,
I guess, revealed some of these.</p>
<p>If you believe the science that came out of it, which we do, of course,
then it's saying that there really is Malay ancestry in Peranakan quite
clearly, quite distinctly.</p>
<p><strong>Rishii </strong>So based on your study, which legend do you think
corresponds to your results the most?</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Foo </strong>The one that involves a female Malay ancestor.
So the research reveals, and it's published and peer-reviewed, etc., reveals
that about six to nine generations ago, a Malay female ancestor exists
in this Peranakan people. But don't forget that this was taking the bloods
of individuals that are self-declaring as Peranakans.</p>
<p>So it's really more, at the end of the day, a lot of this is an agreement
that this is more cultural than a hard and fast rule. You can't say you
are not Peranakan because you don't have this. Because a lot of them are
practising Peranakans today culturally. But in the general analysis of
the entire 700 people, most of them have 5% amount of Malay ancestry in
genetics in their genome.</p>
<p>Which is more than you would find in a person who is self-declared as
a Chinese, like myself, for example.</p>
<p><strong>Rishii </strong>Oh, that's interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Foo</strong> So for myself, which is, I would say I'm fully
Chinese because I don't practise Peranakan culture, etc., my genetics does
not show any Malay ancestry.</p>
<p><strong>Rishii </strong>I used to have a dream where if I could trace
back my ancestry, I was hoping to be related to some South Indian king,
or some royalty. Would you be able to actually trace it back to a single
person?</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Foo </strong>Well, so, Rishii, you probably are a descendant
of Kublai Khan and Genghis Khan. So there are people who --</p>
<p><strong>Rishii </strong>--That's pretty cool.</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Foo </strong>I think all of us are, so that's the sad thing
too. So there is a line of research that is looking exactly at evolution
and evolutionary genetics. So start from this point. Each one of us have
two parents, right? And the two parents have two parents and so on. So
two to the power of N.</p>
<p>And if you build up the pedigree going backwards, you end up with millions
of people as being your ancestors to which you are a descendant. But the
reality is that it wasn't so many people that lived during that time. There
is a lot of people that occupy more than one position in that tree. So
it's more a web than a tree.</p>
<p><strong>Rishii </strong>Okay. I see that's an interesting way to put it,
like a web.</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Foo </strong>So in this web, if you go back enough times,
there's such a thing known as a genetic isopoint where everybody that lived
in that year, if they have descendants living today, they would be the
ancestor of everybody today.</p>
<p><strong>Jacy </strong>Whoa, that is mind-blowing.</p>
<p><strong>Rishii </strong>So you're saying that everyone, okay, not everyone,
but a lot of the people who are listening to this podcast are probably
related to Genghis Khan.</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Foo </strong>Yeah, it's true. Yes, because if you can say
that Genghis Khan has a descendant today, then he must be an ancestor to
everybody today, if he has passed that isogenetic point.</p>
<p><strong>Rishii </strong>Whoa, okay. That's a fact that I'm going to use
as any icebreaker now that I'm a descendant of Genghis Khan. But that's
so interesting, right? I don't think we've looked at ancestry that way,
at least for a layman like me. We always thought, everyone's different
roots and different people, but if we go down that route, it's a web and
it's all just linked to a few people.</p>
<p><strong>Jacy </strong>Yes, it means all of us are actually related and
connected to one another.</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Foo </strong>Yes, absolutely. That is exactly the point,
that there is sufficient inbreeding, if you look at it at a very high level.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rishii </strong>Wow, okay. Maybe we'll not dwell too much into
that. I do not want to ruin any relationships.</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Foo </strong>But also the point that there are many of us
who share ancestors that we are not even aware of. I think that's the most
important thing that comes out of this.</p>
<p><strong>Rishii </strong>So if you really put in effort to do research
and samples, you can actually find a lot of similarities.</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Foo </strong>A really good one is in the UK, because in
the UK, the royal family line, they really know who each king and queen
descended from. They can trace the ancestry, at least in the royal line,
all the way up to, let's say, Edward I and so on. If Edward I, and he does
have ancestors in the royal family today, or descendants in the royal family
today, he's actually the ancestor of everybody living in England today.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rishii </strong>Whoa. That's pretty insane. Okay, that seems similar
to what you referenced, a Richard Dawkins quote on another podcast, Third
Spacing, about how our 185th million grandfather was a fish. So, ah, the
fish in the market my cousins, Prof? I wonder.</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Foo </strong>It's a very different looking fish. Okay, please
do look up Richard Dawkins' book. I mean, it's fascinating. I think it
really helps you to rethink life altogether. And it's true, if you think
that, okay, so the analogy he uses, and here I'm just reconfiguring what
he actually says. Okay, so it's not my own thinking. If you put the photograph
of your father, and then your father's father, and his father, and his
father, and line it all the way back.</p>
<p>And if you go back to that generation I described to you, it's actually
the picture of a fish. And then if you go back even further, I mean, it
depends on how far you want to go, then it's a single cell, for example,
you know, the beginning of life.</p>
<p><strong>Rishii </strong>Right. So, in a sense, it's like a fish when humans
were not around.</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Foo </strong>Yeah, exactly. So, the idea is that it's very
hard to say when species started. Because the transition is, it's so hard
to think of this in the evolutionary time frame. Okay. And that's where
our human brain maybe cannot even think of it. Right. I mean, even in our
human life, I mean, when did you stop being a teenager and becoming an
adult? It's a gradual process. Right. That happens, right?</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Foo </strong>And that's the same when homo sapiens became
homo sapiens, and before it was a species before that. And the thing that
I find it hard to square up even is that species can only breed to give
its own species. Right. So, how does a new species come out of that? So,
these are really tough questions to get over in the mind, but it's just
explained by this very gradual process over evolutionary time.</p>
<p><strong>Rishii </strong>I mean, I guess that's the mysteries of the world,
right? Like we'll never figure out, like, just when we think we have all
the answers, the questions change.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jacy </strong>Yes.<strong> </strong>That is the beauty of science.</p>
<p>[Synthesizer music plays]</p>
<p><strong>Rishii </strong>Hello there, it's time for the mid-roll ad. You're
probably listening to this on the MRT with headphones or maybe out loud.
Have you ever thought about the DNA that encodes the shape of your ears?
Did you know that the University of Pittsburgh scientists found out that
49 genes contribute to earlobe attachment? Head down to the Science Centre
Singapore to learn more weird facts about DNA and the human body.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rishii </strong>I am here to ask all the paiseh questions as I
promised at the start of this show. So, what exactly is DNA? For those
who have been listening to this podcast up till this moment and they're
like, why is this guy talking about DNA? What exactly is DNA?</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Foo </strong>What do you think Jacy? What should we say?</p>
<p><strong>Rishii </strong>Help me out here.</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Foo </strong>It's the thing that I mentioned about the four
bases or the four nucleic acids, A, C, G and T. These are the four letters
of life. And if you take out the DNA and sequence it, it literally is the
four letters in the different sequence. And every cell in our body has
that blueprint of those letters. So, every cell has the same sequence.</p>
<p><strong>Rishii </strong>So, essentially, it is what makes us, us, in the
most abstract way possible that I can put it.</p>
<p><strong>Jacy </strong>So, it's like a code in a sense where we have all
these four letters and they are arranged in different orders and then different
orders of the letters will give us a different code. And then the code
will determine different characteristics that we have or different features.
For example, like the proteins in our body, the colour of our eyes, the
colour of our hair, something like that.</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Foo </strong>We mentioned that every cell has the same DNA
code. So, that's like the blueprint. And the blueprint, as what Jacy says,
gives rise to all the ways in which the cells function. And actually, if
you want to take one more step further, the interesting thing in recent
years is the discovery that different cells function differently even though
they have the same blueprint.</p>
<p>So, a brain cell in the same person, a brain cell and his lung cell and
his heart cell and liver cell all have the same blueprint, the same DNA
code. But they do different things and they function differently. The brain
cell functions differently from the liver cell.</p>
<p><strong>Rishii </strong>Is that because there are different parts of the
body?</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Foo </strong>No. So, really, at the end of the day, it turns
out that the code is just a blueprint and different parts of the code are
being used in different cells. So, it's like an analogy I've used. It's
like a songbook. Every cell has exactly the same songbook, that's their
blueprint, but different songs are being sung from that songbook.</p>
<p><strong>Rishii </strong>Right. So, they're just using the notes differently
in a sense. Exactly. Okay. I think that's a nice way to put it.</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Foo </strong>So, because the different notes are being used,
then they are carrying out the function so differently. And when we move
into a disease from health, then some of these songs become out of tune.</p>
<p><strong>Rishii </strong>Oh, okay.</p>
<p><strong>Jacy </strong>So, I think what you're referring to is your research
on epigenetics, if I'm not wrong. So, Prof just gave us a very good analogy
about what epigenetics is. And I believe he's referring to his research
on how the epigenetics affects heart health and also heart disease. So,
maybe you can tell us a bit about that.</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Foo </strong>Yeah, Jacy, thanks. So, it's also around Nobel
Prize winning stuff that came out 20 years ago when they discovered that
the way that different parts of the genome is being used is based on certain
modification and features that drive how the genome is used in each cell
type.</p>
<p>And so much to a point where if you can rewire some of these modifications,
you can actually make the cell change and behave differently. So, to give
a more concrete analogy, if you take liver cell and you grow it on a plate
and allowed it to divide, it will always divide into more liver cells because
the code is hardwired there. So, only the songs of a liver cell will sing.</p>
<p>But if you find a way to rewire the genome and make it sing different
songs, you can actually turn the liver cell into a heart cell. And that
was the groundbreaking Nobel Prize 20 years ago. So, with that knowledge,
everyone has gone hunting for the rewiring processes.</p>
<p>And the thinking is that in our context of the heart, if the songs are
going out of tune, can we find specific ways to retune it so that the wires
are back into health? Okay. And that's the epigenetic research that we're
working on. Wow.</p>
<p><strong>Jacy </strong>So, if you compare it, maybe go back to the analogy
of a songbook, there are little markers to tell the cell which pages to
read from. So, if you were to find out which markers are marking the pages,
and then maybe you can tweak them a bit, then maybe we have the possibility
of helping to reduce the risk of certain diseases like heart disease.</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Foo </strong>Exactly. Yeah, very nicely put to Jacy. So,
for example, in the case of the heart, when we have heart attack, the heart
muscle dies, right? The cells die. And it gets replaced by these things
called fibroblasts. They're all scarring cells, scar cells. So, these guys
came up, not my lab, but some other lab showed that you can actually put
in these rewiring factors and rewire so that the scar cells turn into heart
cells.</p>
<p><strong>Rishii </strong>So, completely changing them.</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Foo </strong>And making them behave differently altogether.
So, if you think that scar cells, you don't want them, you should get them
back to heart cells, you can actually change the cause of heart failure
completely. So, this has worked seemingly in mouse. We also see it in our
own hands using those rewiring factors. And I think there are people in
the world who are trying to ultimately bring it to clinic one day.</p>
<p><strong>Rishii </strong>So, you're kind of reversing damages to the heart
that was previously thought, this is a permanent damage. After a few heart
attacks, your heart is pretty weak and there's nothing that we can do except
just take good care of it. But now you can actually rewire it to be back
to how it was.</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Foo </strong>Yeah, so good that you are saying it like that,
Rishii. Definitely spot on.</p>
<p><strong>Rishii </strong>Oh, okay, great. I learned something today.</p>
<p><strong>Jacy </strong>Yes, because I think usually if I understand correctly,
after a heart attack, there will be scar tissue on the wall of the heart.
Then that interferes somewhat with the pumping of the heart. And then that
will contribute or lead to heart failure, which for now, I think can only
be managed by good lifestyle control medications. So, this is really some
groundbreaking research. If we really can reverse these changes, I think
we can provide people a new lease of life.</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Foo </strong>Yes, absolutely, Jacy. I mean, that's the whole
space of regenerative medicine as well, to get organs to repair themselves,
especially organs like the heart that are not reparative.</p>
<p><strong>Rishii </strong>We would now like to play some games with you.
Word association game. So, basically, we will be asking you certain words
in quickfire. And we just want to see what comes to your mind first. First
word is health.</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Foo </strong>Disease.</p>
<p><strong>Rishii </strong>Disease. Why is that the first thing that comes
to your mind?</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Foo </strong>Well, that's the opposite, right? So, people
are healthy, but they become diseased. We want to convert them back to
health. At the moment in my head, this is the juxtaposition I keep thinking
about.</p>
<p><strong>Rishii </strong>Apple.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Foo </strong>Orange.</p>
<p><strong>Rishii </strong>So, it's going with opposite fruits now.</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Foo </strong>It's better than saying doctor, right? Apple
a day keeps the doctor away.</p>
<p><strong>Rishii </strong>Cliché, I see. Heart.</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Foo </strong>Lung.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rishii </strong>Oh, why would that come up?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Foo </strong>So, in our research space, very often, heart
research institutes are set together with heart and lung institutes.</p>
<p><strong>Rishii </strong>Right. Is there some correlation?</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Foo </strong>Maybe it's just organs in the chest.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rishii </strong>Right. They're like cousins. Okay. Bloodline.</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Foo </strong>Oh, vikings. How come I'm thinking of the word
vikings?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rishii </strong>Was it a show? &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Foo </strong>Could well be. So, the way that blood is so
gory and the Vikings are fighting people. And then there's always this
talk about ancestry. My knowledge about ancestry is very British and European
based. And it always dates to the Vikings.</p>
<p><strong>Rishii </strong>For me, bloodline would have been like <em>Game of Thrones</em> because
they're always talking about ancestry and who has the right to sit on the
throne. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Jacy </strong>It's always associated with royalty in pop culture
for some reason.</p>
<p><strong>Rishii </strong>Right. And pure blood. But good to know what shows
you like, Prof.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Peranakan.</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Foo </strong>What's that? What? Buah keluak.</p>
<p><strong>Rishii </strong>Oh, that's the dish.</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Foo </strong>Yeah. It uses a nut.</p>
<p><strong>Rishii </strong>Yes. And actually the nut is like a bit toxic
or something, right? It's true.</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Foo </strong>And they need to soak it for the longest of
time to then actually cook it. Right. Right. There's some really special
technique that goes into cooking that dish.</p>
<p><strong>Rishii </strong>Did you have a lot of it during the research phase?</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Foo </strong>Yeah. Probably too much.</p>
<p><strong>Jacy </strong><em>Gattaca</em>? Is it <em>Gattaca</em>?</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Foo </strong>Oh yeah, that's the amazing sci-fi show that
quite a number of us talk about from time to time. There was a moment in
time when we were crafting the first heart disease project. A lot of the
projects in our clinical space always come with abbreviations. The one
that I'm now running together with team is called Project RESET. There's
always a name to it. They wanted to use “Gattaca” as a name because it
was very DNA-based. I've not actually watched the movie myself but it sounds
really interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Rishii </strong>It's a movie, like an old movie?</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Foo </strong>Science fiction movie where people came in
and they could buy their DNA. They can exchange their DNA from a window
like in the bank teller.</p>
<p><strong>Rishii </strong>Wow, okay I need to check this out.</p>
<p><strong>Rishii </strong>Thank you so much, Prof, for joining us today.
I think we had a lot of fun learning about our ancestry, your Peranakan
Genome Project. I think my biggest takeaway was that I'm either linked
to a fish or to Genghis Khan. What about you, Jacy?</p>
<p><strong>Jacy </strong>Wow, it was absolutely mind-blowing to hear that.
But it was also super fascinating to hear about all your research on heart
health and about the prospect of regenerative medicine and how the different
markers can help different cells to perform different roles. It's really
exciting research.</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Foo </strong>Very nice, Jacy. Very nice, Rishii. Thanks
for giving the chance at this.</p>
