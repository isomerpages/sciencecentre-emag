<p>Stepping into the Science Centre, you are immediately greeted with the
hall of optical illusions, one of our staple exhibits. Even as a kid, I
could vividly remember the wall of Albert Einstein Hollow-Face Illusions,
staring into my soul.</p>
<p>Now as an adult, optical illusions continue to amaze and boggle me, but
the science behind them has always escaped me. There are many kinds of
optical illusions, but I have chosen to break down four everyday illusions
that you don’t have to go to the Optical Illusion Museum to witness for
yourself.</p>

<h2><strong>1. The Dress</strong></h2>
<p>We all remember The Dress. A widely circulated photo of a seemingly plain
looking dress, that ended up sparking fierce online debates – is the white
and gold or black and blue?</p>
<p>It became such a viral phenomenon and internet meme there’s even a substantial
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_dress" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Wikipedia page about it</a>. Unfortunately, five years after upending
the field, vision scientists still lack a full scientific consensus on
how this happened.</p>
<p>The main theory is that the photo is contextually ambiguous – there are
hardly any clues about if it was taken indoors or outdoors, and whether
the dress is backlit or frontlit. These are actually important cues for
our vision – without them, our brains are forced to make sense of what
we see by making assumptions.</p>
<p>If we assume the photo to be taken in natural light or the dress as being
in the shadow, we’d be more inclined to see the photo as white and gold
as our brains automatically discount the blue light of daylight or shadows.
Discounting the gold light would result in seeing it as black and blue,
which is the actual colour of the dress.</p>
