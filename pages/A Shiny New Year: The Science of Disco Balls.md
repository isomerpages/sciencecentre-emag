<p>New Year's Eve: a time for glitz and glamour, from spectacular fireworks
to shiny confetti, fizzy champagne, and glittery outfits. Not to mention:
splendid light shows and dancing late into the night! You may have seen
disco balls suspended above revellers at New Year's Eve parties, but have
you considered the disco ball as a technological device?</p>
<p>In this feature, we peel back the reflective layers of this party favourite
and explore the physics of the disco ball, the scientific origins of this
holiday decor, and how festive fun can even help us illuminate the future
of space science.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I'm a mirrorball / I'll show you every version of yourself tonight /
I'll get you out on the floor / Shimmering beautiful" - Taylor Swift, "Mirrorball"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How does the disco ball create the "shimmering beautiful" displays referenced
in Taylor Swift's song? Disco balls are <a href="https://doi.org/10.1119/1.4967890" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">spherical objects</a> covered with
hundreds or thousands of <a href="https://www.sciencing.com/plane-mirror-5103685/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">plane mirrors</a>.
When a light shines on the disco ball, the little mirrors reflect the light
beam at different angles all at the same, scattering light spots all over
the room. As the disco ball rotates, the light spots move, creating brilliant
displays.</p>
<p>Fittingly, the dazzling novel lighting effect was first engineered by
electricians for a shindig. The <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/653099/disco-ball-facts-history" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">earliest mention of a disco ball</a> appears
in an 1897 issue of <em>The Electrical Worker</em>, a trade publication
in Charlestown, Massachusetts, in a description of a ballroom that featured
a "mirrored ball" above a dance floor. However, this was a one-off item
not intended for commercial use.</p>
<p>The next tangible disco ball was a <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/64276/myriad-reflector-early-forgotten-disco-ball" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">"myriad reflector"</a> patented
by Louis Bernard Woeste in 1917. A globe 27 inches wide plastered with
over 1200 tiny mirrors, the device was advertised for its novel lighting
effects, with <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/64276/myriad-reflector-early-forgotten-disco-ball" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">one magazine ad</a> cheekily
comparing the myriad reflector's magnificent illuminations to the Milky
Way or constellations. In the 1920s, this proto-disco ball was sold to
entertainment venues like <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/653099/disco-ball-facts-history" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">dance halls, jazz clubs, and circuses</a> to
throw brilliant, radiant light around the room in an era where glitzy artificial
lighting was not common.</p>

</p>
<p>However, the disco ball famously reached its peak popularity in the 1970s
with disco fever and bands like the Bee Gees taking off across the USA
and even in Singapore, where <a href="https://biblioasia.nlb.gov.sg/vol-15/issue-1/apr-jun-2019/disco-fever/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">local discotheques</a> hung
up their own disco balls.</p>
<p>More recently, the disco ball experienced what the <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/26/style/disco-ball-comeback.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">New York Times</a> </em>called
a "comeback" during the COVID-19 pandemic, with searches of the item surging
on various e-shopping platforms as consumers sought to inject joy and embrace
nostalgia during times of crisis. Apple even added the <a href="https://selector.news/2022/03/20/apple-iphone-disco-ball-emoji/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">disco ball emoji</a> in
2021 <strong>[why?].</strong>
</p>
<p>These spheres of joy are manufactured by moulding metal into perfect spheres,
cutting glass mirrors into strips or smaller shapes to affix to the sphere
with glue paste, and testing the final products for its reflectiveness
and light refraction. You can watch the mesmerising process of two artisanal
disco ball factories here: one from the <a href="https://youtu.be/XXA-bQj5n9Q?si=v2yBwYxIRyOgiSQr" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">USA</a> and one
from <a href="https://youtu.be/CnnTzKPM6tw?si=o1X1LRBzk_OZ73HK" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Japan</a>. <strong>[REVISE TO FIT </strong>

<p><strong>[ADD SCIENTIFIC FACT ABOUT WHAT MAKES A 'GOOD' DISCO BALL HERE]</strong>
</p>
<p>Disco balls aren't just pretty ornaments or kitschy decor from the past.
In fact, applying the principles of disco balls to the space industry may
one day mean we can welcome the new year in style on Mars or another planet
in the future.</p>
<p>In 1976, NASA's Laser Geodynamics Satellite (LAGEOS) launched, a 408-kg
satellite with "no sensors, electronics, [nor] moving parts" (<a href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/lageos" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">NASA Science</a>),
"a brass core surrounded by an aluminum shell that's covered in 426 retroreflectors"
that closely resembled a "giant disco ball" (<a href="https://www.space.com/32981-nasa-disco-ball-satellite-still-in-space.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Space.com</a>).</p>

</p>
<p>LAGEOS is still orbiting Earth today as a permanent reference point for
"high-precision laser ranging", its "hundreds of reflecting prisms" helping
scientists "measure the movement of Earthâ€™s tectonic plates, detect irregularities
in the rotation of the planet, weigh it, and track small shifts in its
center of mass" (<a href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/lageos" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">NASA Science</a>).
Wild to think that all of this data can come from throwing a giant disco
ball in space!</p>
<p>Disco balls could also aid astronomy education down on Earth. This year,
a group of astronomers from various institutions published <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6552/ad1fa0" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">a paper in </a><em><a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6552/ad1fa0" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Physics Education</a></em> titled
"<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14173" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Why every observatory needs a disco ball"</a>.
They proposed that disco balls could be operated by observatories and classrooms
as cheap and readily available pinhole cameras that could "project bright
light sources (such as the Sun) on a wall or screen" for large groups.</p>
<p>The researchers experimented with implementing disco balls when observing
various astronomical phenomena such as solar eclipses and concluded that
"commercial disco balls provide a safe, effective and instructive way of
observing the Sun", not to mention, and "easy and fun" way to engage the
public with science (<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6552/ad1fa0" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Cumming et al., 2024</a>).</p>
<p>In a feature for <em><a href="https://physicsworld.com/a/light-fever-bringing-disco-to-astronomy/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Physics World</a> </em>written
by Laura Hiscott, researcher Robert Cumming explains that he got the idea
for the paper after hanging up a disco ball for a New Year's Eve party,
watching the ball's illuminations, and realising that <a href="https://physicsworld.com/a/light-fever-bringing-disco-to-astronomy/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">"each bright patch on the walls was an image of the Sun."</a>
</p>
<p>The deceptively simple object of the disco ball helps show us how science
and art make our world merry and bright. As we reflect on the end of the
year, here's to wishing you a sci-sational, shiny start to 2025!</p>
