<h4><strong>Episode 3: Exploring Spacetech with Dr. Christopher Luwanga (Galamad Aerospace)</strong></h4>
<p>Singapore may be known as the Little Red Dot, but its ambitions are astronomical.
In this episode, we explore how this tiny island nation is becoming an
unexpected player in the space industry, with homegrown spacetech companies
reaching for the stars. We chat with Dr. Christopher Luwanga, the CEO and
founder of Galamad Aerospace, a space start-up based in Singapore. We discuss
his journey growing up in Malawi to completing his engineering PhD at Nanyang
Technological University in Singapore. Along the way, Christopher talks
about the awe-inspiring vastness of the universe, the importance of reuseable
satellites, and shares his vision of the future of space exploration.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>Guest Biography</strong></h4>
<p>Dr. Christopher Luwanga is a space engineer and physicist based in Singapore,
and originally from Malawi, Africa. As founder of Galamad Aerospace, he
is leading a team of designers, engineers, and builders of spacecraft for
the new age of consumer applications that are built around space technologies.
One of the most exciting applications is that of broadband connectivity
from and via outer space. This extension into space not only creates a
powerful, resilient complement to our existing terrestrial network infrastructure
but in some places is the only practical means to connect people to the
internet. Galamad Aerospace is also specifically developing the PROSat,
a programmable, reuseable, and highly manoeuvrable spacecraft that will
ultimately enable smart constellations that do not unnecessarily crowd
or pollute the space environment.</p>
