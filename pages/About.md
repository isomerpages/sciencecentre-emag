<p>Enter <em>Void Deck</em> to explore the universe from the heartlands.</p>
<p><em>Void Deck</em> is your portal to local science stories published by
Science Centre Singapore. Inspired by spaceship decks and the gathering
places of every HDB block, we spotlight the curious ways science connects
us.</p>
<p>We publish articles that make you look at our island home differently,
from the chemistry of mala xiang guo to the geometry of Peranakan tiles.</p>
<p>Read features on Space, Technology, Environment, Mind &amp; Body, and
Culture from a uniquely Singaporean perspective. Listen to conversations
with local science changemakers, enjoy science-focused reviews of popular
media, and get crafty with our DIY STEAM activities for the young at heart.</p>
