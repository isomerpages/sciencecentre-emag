<p>Enter <em>Void Deck</em> to explore the universe from the heartlands.</p>
<p><em>Void Deck</em> is your portal to local science stories published by
Science Centre Singapore. Inspired by spaceship decks and the gathering
places of every HDB block, we spotlight the curious ways science connects
us.</p>
<p>We publish articles that make you look at our island home differently,
from the chemistry of mala xiang guo to the geometry of Peranakan tiles.</p>
<p>Read features on Space, Technology, Environment, Mind &amp; Body, and
Food from a uniquely Singaporean perspective. Listen to conversations with
Singapore science changemakers, enjoy science-themed reviews of popular
media, and get crafty with our DIY activities for the young at heart.</p>
<p>The views and opinions expressed in Void Deck articles and podcast episodes
are those of the individual authors and contributors. They do not necessarily
reflect the official policy or position of Science Centre Singapore or
the Ministry of Education.</p>
