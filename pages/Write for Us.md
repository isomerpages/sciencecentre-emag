<p>Interested in publishing an article in Void Deck? While Void Deck is edited
by Science Centre Singapore staff, we accept pitches from the other science
geeks on the island beyond our Jurong East bubble.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We're looking for quirky science stories with a distinctive local perspective
- think TheSmartScienceLocal. Or Mothership, if Mothership was about spacecrafts
and astronomy. Read our About page and our previous articles to get a sense
of our content and voice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We write for a general audience aged 25 and up, and we're most excited
about articles that demystify complicated trends (generative AI! cloud
seeding!) and spark curiosity and wonder about science in the Singapore
public.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Send us your ideas for a hot take on the physics of the latest science-fiction
anime, data visualizations of birds on the East Asian-Australasian Flyway,
and feature articles on the science of steaming zongzi.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this sounds like your jam, drop us an email at <a href="mailto:transmedia@science.edu.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">transmedia@science.edu.sg</a> with
the subject line "Pitch: Your Proposed Article Title" and the following
details:&nbsp;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Your Full Name, Email Address, Current Position and Affiliation&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your Social Media Handles&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your 150-300 word pitch (including big idea/thesis, significance for Singaporean
millennials and older, evidence already collected, proposed title, article
category, and expected wordcount)&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Links or attachments of previous science writing, if any&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll get back to you within a week. If we accept your pitch, you will
be asked to send us your first draft within two weeks. Science Centre staff
will help with developmental edits and proofreading.&nbsp;</p>
